I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Prof. Yves Perriard, my thesis director, for welcoming me into his laboratory, supporting my ideas and efforts and guiding me through my doctoral studies. His advice, enthusiasm and excellent leadership has truly inspired me and moulded my professional and personal development.

I would like to express my deepest appreciation to Prof. Bruno Dehez, Dr. Luigi Borelli, and Prof. Yves Bellouard, who graciously accepted to review this thesis, and to Dr. Denis Gillet for being the jury president.

I am also deeply grateful to my advisors Dr. Morgan Almanza and Dr. Thomas Martinez whom I deeply appreciate for giving me their time during our long discussions, their insightful comments and for giving all the valuable advice and ideas that has made my research experience productive and fulfilling.

I am especially grateful to a number of friends and colleagues who has made my PhD life, not just joyful but also truly memorable. I am thankful to Adrien Thabuis for his friendship, his ingenious ideas, advice and for the amazing collaborative efforts we have fostered. Without Paolo Germano and his help on all my prototypes, this thesis would not be a possibility and I would like to express my deepest gratitude. I would also like to thank my colleagues, Dr. Yoan Civet, Camilo Hernandez, Raphael Mottet and Patricio Peralta for their compassion and their willingness to help me no matter what throughout my research. The Integrated Actuators Laboratory has the most friendly, welcoming and dedicated team and I would like to extend my thanks to each and every one of them, especially Sofia Ntella and Pooneh Mohaghegh.

Most of all, I am indebted to my family. My mother, father and sister have also supported me unconditionally and encouraged me in all my endeavours. I am forever grateful for their guidance and without them, none of my successes would matter. I would also like to thank my friends and girlfriend for supporting me along this journey. Their valued support has allowed me to stay motivated and determined during my thesis.
