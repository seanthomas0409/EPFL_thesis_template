\chapter{Predicting the Shape Memory Effect}\label{chap:sma-model}
In this chapter, different modelling strategies, such as finite element modelling and analytical modelling, are presented. Here, the modelling techniques are employed in the context of the traditional SMA actuator design methodology. Furthermore, the bias spring actuator model and a simplified model are presented.
