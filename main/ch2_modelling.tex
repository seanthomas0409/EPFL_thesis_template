\chapter{Predicting the Shape Memory Effect}\label{chap:sma-model}
\section{Introduction}
% Intro to thermal SMAs (mention magnetic)
Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) are a type of smart material that are known to exhibit some form of strain recovery. This exotic behaviour to revert back to its original shape comes from their ability to change their microscopic crystalline structures when subjected to some kind of non-mechanical external stimulus. Some types of SMAs are able to recover their original structure when exposed to a magnetic field and thus, they are often referred to as magnetic shape memory alloys as shown in the work by \cite{faranFerromagneticShapeMemory2016}. However, the most commonly used type of SMAs have the ability to recover large amounts of strain when exposed to a thermal load and is also the smart material used in this work.

\end{figure}

As shown in \cref{fig:sma-phase-transformations}, these alloys exist in two main phases : a stable low temperature Martensitic (M) phase and a stable high temperature Austenitic (A) phase. The transition between these phases due to the realignment of the micro-structures is responsible for the interesting phenomenons observed in these alloys. A rise in temperature, above a certain temperature threshold, causes the recovery of residual misalignment of the crystalline structures during mechanical loading and unloading. Macroscopically, this realignment is observed as a recovery of any earlier strain imposed on the alloy and this is often referred to as the Shape Memory Effect (SME).

\end{table}

The SME was first reported in the work by \cite{changPlasticDeformationDiffusionless1951} in the 1950s. However, since then, there exists several different alloys that demonstrate the same interesting behaviour as shown in the work by \cite{WAYMAN19903}. The most commonly used alloy among these is the Ni-Ti alloy that was discovered at the US Naval Ordnance Laboratory in 1963 as thus, the alloy is often referred to as \textit{NiTiNOL}. In this work, the almost equiatomic Ni-Ti based SMA alloy is used due to its commercial availability in various different geometries and its excellent mechanical properties as shown in \cref{tab:niti-material-properties}. Furthermore, various additives and changes in atomic ratios can be used to change the transition temperatures threshold. The change in phase occurs over a range of temperature and thus, as shown in \cref{fig:sma-phase-transformations}, when transitioning from the M to the A phase, the starting and finishing transition temperature are represented as $\As$ and $\Af$ while the starting and finishing M phase transition temperature thresholds are represented as $\Ms$ and $\Mf$, respectively.

    \label{fig:sma-phases}
\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:sma-phases}, the entire SME cycle can be observed along with the various changes in the phase and crystalline structures. At low temperature, the alloy exists in the twinned M phase. When subjected to a certain critical stress threshold, there are some shear lattice distortions that allow the material to be highly deformed ($\sim8$\%) and retain this strain. This effect is often referred to as detwinning and transforms the alloy to the detwinned M state. At high temperatures, above a certain threshold, the alloy transforms into the A phase and the crystalline structures are restructured such that the material reverts back to its original shape before the mechanical loading. If the material is mechanically loaded while in the A phase or by decreasing the transition temperature below the ambient temperature, any deformations imposed on the material is immediately recovered. This effect is known as Superelasticity or Pseudoelasticity (SE) as shown in the work by \cite{otsukaPseudoelasticityShapeMemory1986}. However, if the material is allowed to cool below the transition temperature, the alloy reverts back to the M phase where it can be deformed and retain its shape once again. This entire cycle is known as the SME and can be exploited to create highly compact and energy dense actuators. In \cref{fig:dsc-graph}, the required latent heat of transformation can be observed during the forward and backward transformations between the M and A phases. Often, as shown in the work by \cite{heDSCAnalysisReverse2004} and represented in \cref{fig:dsc-graph}, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) can be used to accurately measure these transition temperature thresholds.

As shown in the previous chapter, the main design criteria for SMA-based actuators is having a small footprint or being lightweight. Thus, when designing actuators, the active element and the biasing elements have to be perfectly balanced so that neither subsystems are oversized which results in wasted space or weight. Furthermore, as the cooling is often passive in SMA-powered actuators, employing larger SMA elements can exponentially decrease the bandwidth of the resulting actuator. The accurate sizing of the SMA element and biasing elements are, thus, critical in designing a compact and dynamic SMA actuator. In this chapter, various analytical and finite element method (FEM) models are presented so as to accurately predict the SME. Furthermore, using the developed models, various complex and simplified sizing methodology are described and presented such that the SMA can be adequately sized for any given application resulting in an energy dense actuator.

\section{Analytical Modelling of the SME}

% Types and history of models
% Brinson model
The Shape Memory Effect (SME) is a difficult process to model analytically due to the different phase transformations and interdependent variables. In the work by \cite{liangConstitutiveModelingShape1990a}, the authors presented a set of constitutive equations to describe a unified one-dimensional phenomenological model that incorporates the multi-physical nature of the SME and its internal variables. This model takes into account the phase transformations from the M and the A phases. The basic constitutive model presented by \cite{liangConstitutiveModelingShape1990a} is as follows,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:liang_model_1}
  d\sigma = \frac{\delta\sigma}{\delta\varepsilon}d\varepsilon + \frac{\delta\sigma}{\delta\xi}d\xi + \frac{\delta\sigma}{\delta T}dT
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:liang_model_2}
  d\sigma = Ed\varepsilon + \Omega d\xi + \Theta dT
\end{equation}
 which can be further simplified using constant material functions as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:liang_model_3}
  \sigma-\sigma_0 = E(\varepsilon-\varepsilon_0) + \Omega(\xi-\xi_0) + \Theta(T-T_0)
\end{equation}
where $E(\varepsilon,\xi,T)$ represents the Young's modulus of the SMA material, $\Omega(\varepsilon,\xi,T)$ represents the transformation tensor and $\Theta(\varepsilon,\xi,T)$ is the thermal coefficient of expansion of the SMA. Here, $\sigma$ represents the stress, $\varepsilon$ represents the strain, $T$ represents the temperature and $\xi$ represents the martensite fraction of the material. Here, the subscript 0 indicates the initial conditions before the current phase transformation. Based on experimental evidence, as stated in the work by \cite{liangConstitutiveModelingShape1990a}, the Young's Modulus, $E$, of the SMA is directly proportional to the martensite fraction of the material. Thus, the following assumption is made to estimate the Young's modulus :
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:youngs-modulus}
  E(\varepsilon,\xi,T) = E(\xi) = E_A + \xi(E_M-E_A)
\end{equation}
where, $E_A$ and $E_M$ represent the Young's modulus of the SMA when it is entirely in the Austenite phase or the Martensite phase, respectively. Subsequently, the subscript $M$ and $A$ represent whether the material is currently in the Martensite or Austenite phases, respectively. Furthermore, in the case of SMAs, a material limit must be imposed such that the maximum residual strain, $\varepsilon_L$ of the SME is incorporated into the model. This imposition creates a relationship between the Young's modulus and the transformation tensor :
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tensor-youngsmodulus}
  \Omega = -\varepsilon_L E
\end{equation}
In SMAs, the driving force that transforms the material from the A and M phases is the chemical free energy as a function of temperature and stress. In order to depict the martensite fraction as a function of stress and temperature during transformation, \cite{liangConstitutiveModelingShape1990a} developed an experimentally based cosine model, which fits well with experimental observations. The constitutive equations for the transformation from the A phase to the M phase, for $C_M(T-\Ms)<\sigma<C_M(T-\Mf)$, are described as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:liang-MA}
  \xi=\frac{1-\xi_0}{2}cos\left[a_M\left(T-\Mf-\frac{\sigma}{C_M}\right)\right]+\frac{1+\xi_0}{2}
\end{equation}
while the reverse transformation, with $C_A(T-\Af)<\sigma<C_A(T-\As)$, from the M phase to the A phase is described as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:liang-AM}
  \xi=\frac{\xi_0}{2}cos\left[a_A\left(T-\As-\frac{\sigma}{C_A}\right)\right]+\frac{\xi_0}{2}
\end{equation}
where $\xi_0$ represents the initial martensite fraction prior to the current transformation, $\sigma$ and $T$ is the current applied stress and temperature on the material, and $a_M$ and $a_A$ are expressed as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:aM-aA}
  a_M=\frac{\pi}{\Ms-\Mf},~a_A=\frac{\pi}{\Af-\As}
\end{equation}
The material property $C_M$ and $C_A$, as shown in \cref{fig:phase-diagram-graph}, represent relationship between the critical stresses and transformation temperatures of the SMA. These constants are experimentally deduced and are considered linear as shown in the work by \cite{yooDevelopmentMartensiteTransformation2015}. These constants determine the critical stresses, $\sigma_\mathrm{cr}$ required to induce transformation or the determine the critical transformation temperatures at a certain imposed stress. The evolution of the martensite fraction based on the constitutive equations are shown in \cref{fig:sma-temperature-transformation-model}.

    \label{fig:sma-temperature-transformation-model}
\end{figure}

The \cite{liangConstitutiveModelingShape1990a} model is effective at modelling the transformations from the martensite to the austenite phase and vice versa. This model is quite accurate when sizing actuators that have higher strokes where the material has always reached its maximum residual strain. However, the model does not take into account the crystal structure changes that exist in the M phase at lower temperatures. This crystal structure change, referred to as detwinning, as shown in \cref{fig:sma-phases}, occurs entirely within the M phase and results in a highly non-linear behaviour when a critical stress is imposed on the material.

The current model has described the internal state variable, $\xi$, to represent only the percentage of the material that has been changed into the M phase and does not consider the detwinning process. However, in the work by \cite{brinsonOneDimensionalConstitutiveBehavior1993}, the authors have separated the internal state variable into two parts, the temperature-induced M phase $\xi_T$ and the stress-induced M phase $\xi_S$ as described by the following relationship:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:xis-xit}
  \xi = \xi_S + \xi_T
\end{equation}
This distinction allows the modelling of the shape memory effect starting from the M phase and the material's superelasticity. This division of the martensite fraction appropriately captures the microscopic activity of the material in the M phase. When the material is in the M phase at lower temperatures, $\xi_T$ accounts for the temperature-induced crystal structure. Once sufficient stress is imposed on the material, the detwinning process converts the crystal structure to increase the value of $\xi_S$.

Now, based on the changes made using the Brinson model, the original constitutive equations \cref{eq:liang_model_3}, are adapted as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:brinson_model_1}
  d\sigma = \frac{\delta\sigma}{\delta\varepsilon}d\varepsilon + \frac{\delta\sigma}{\delta\xi_S}d\xi_S + \frac{\delta\sigma}{\delta\xi_T}d\xi_T + \frac{\delta\sigma}{\delta T}dT
\end{equation}
 which can be further simplified using constant material functions as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:brinson_model_2}
  d\sigma = Ed\varepsilon + \Omega_Sd\xi_S + \Omega_Td\xi_T + \Theta dT
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:brinson_model_3}
  \sigma-\sigma_0 = E(\varepsilon-\varepsilon_0) + \Omega_S(\xi_S-\xi_{S0}) + \Omega_T(\xi_T-\xi_{T0}) + \Theta (T-T_0)
\end{equation}
where the subscript $0$ indicates the initial conditions between the current phase transformations. Here, based on the material restrictions, $\Omega_S=-\varepsilon_L E$ and $\Omega_T\equiv0$.

In the work presented by Brinson, the author has adapted the transformation equations and transformation stresses to represent the modified internal variables. The author was able to described the analytical model for the detwinning process by adapting the transformation equations presented earlier by Liang. Here, the constitutive model must be divided into three phases, due to the complexity of the shape memory effect: the detwinning process, the stress relaxation and the austenitic transformation. The detwinning process can be estimated by using equation \ref{eq:brinson_conv_xis} combined with equation \ref{eq:brinson_model_2}, as presented below, with $T > M_\mathrm{s}$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{s}^\mathrm{cr} + C_M(T - M_\mathrm{s}) < \sigma < \sigma_\mathrm{f}^\mathrm{cr} + C_M(T-M_\mathrm{s})$ :

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:brinson_conv_xis}
  \xi_S = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{\sigma_\mathrm{s}^\mathrm{cr}-\sigma_\mathrm{f}^\mathrm{cr}}[\sigma - \sigma_\mathrm{f}^\mathrm{cr} - C_M(T-M_\mathrm{s})]\right)\frac{1-\xi_{S0}}{2} + \frac{1+\xi_{S0}}{2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:brinson_conv_xit}
  \xi_T = \xi_{T0} - \frac{\xi_{T0}}{1-\xi_{S0}}(\xi_S-\xi_{S0})
\end{equation}

However, for $T<\Ms$ and $\sigmacrs<\sigma<\sigmacrf$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:brinson_conv_xis1}
  \xi_S = \frac{1-\xi_{S0}}{2}\cos\left[\frac{\pi}{\sigmacrs-\sigmacrf}(\sigma - \sigmacrf)\right] + \frac{1+\xi_{S0}}{2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:brinson_conv_xit2}
  \xi_T = \xi_{T0} - \frac{\xi_{T0}}{1-\xi_{S0}}(\xi_S-\xi_{S0})+\Delta_{T\xi}
\end{equation}
where, if $\Mf<T<\Ms$ and $T<T_0$,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:deltaTxi}
  \Delta_{T\xi} = \frac{1-\xi_{T0}}{2}\cos(a_M(T-\Mf))+\frac{1-\xi_{T0}}{2}
\end{equation}
else, $\Delta_{T\xi}=0$

Here, the stress relaxation phase is estimated by keeping $\xi_S$ constant at 1 and by reducing the stress back to 0. Lastly, the austenitic phase transformation can be described using equation \ref{eq:brinson_model_2} and the following equation, for $T>\As$ and $C_A(T-\Af)<\sigma<C_A(T-\As)$:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:A_transf}
  \xi = \frac{\xi_0}{2}\left\{\cos\left[a_A\left(T-A_\mathrm{s}-\frac{\sigma}{C_A}\right)\right]+1\right\}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:a-transf_1}
    \xi_S = \xi_{S0} - \frac{\xi_{S0}}{\xi_0}(\xi_0-\xi)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:a-transf_2}
    \xi_T = \xi_{T0} - \frac{\xi_{T0}}{\xi_0}(\xi_0-\xi)
\end{equation}

where $\Ms$ and $\As$ are the Martensitic and Austenitic transformation start temperatures and similarly, $\Mf$ and $\Af$ are the finish temperatures. While $C_M$ and $C_A$ are the same material properties that tie the internal stresses to a change in transformation temperatures. The details of the constitutive models and the different material constants can be found in work by \cite{brinsonOneDimensionalConstitutiveBehavior1993}. The three phase transformations of the SME, based on the above constitutive equations, can be observed in \cref{fig:brinson-model-stress-strain}.

However, a 3D graph is required to properly display the entire cycle of the shape memory effect as the effect is dependant on the stress and the temperature of the material as shown in \cref{fig:brinson-model-3d}. Here, the material is elongated with the imposition of a stress and the material undergoes the detwinning process where the crystal structures of the material are realigned. When the stress is removed from the material, the strain is retained up to a maximum of $\varepsilon_L$. As the material is heated to a critical transition temperature, the strain is recovered and the material reverts back to its original shape. Finally, the material is cooled down to revert back to its initial state where the cycle can be repeated.

\section{Finite Element Modelling}
The Shape Memory Effect is a complex behaviour that depends on various different material properties and variables. When working with SMA structures that are complex and are actuated in multiple dimensions, the simple one-dimensional constitutive models are no longer feasible. Recent development in modelling of the constitutive models of Shape Memory Alloys has allowed various commercial FEM simulation software to be able to simulate the shape memory effect and superelasticity of the alloy. In this work, \textit{ANSYS, Inc.} was used to simulate the material and predict the effects of applying mechanical and thermal loads to SMA structures as described in \cite{ansysincNonlinearMaterialProperties2021}. The shape memory effect was predicted using a three-dimensional thermomechanical model for stress-induced solid phase changes based on the work by \cite{auricchioRobustIntegrationalgorithmFinitestrain2001} and \cite{souzaThreedimensionalModelSolids1998}. The model is able to simulate all of the fundamental properties of shape memory materials in a 3-D stress state within the context of conventional irreversible thermodynamics. The model used to simulate the SME within the FEM software is based on the free energy potential:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fem-free-energy}
    \Psi(\varepsilon,T,\etr)=\frac{1}{2}(\varepsilon-\etr):E:(\varepsilon-\etr)+\tau_M(T)||\etrprime||+\frac{1}{2}H||\etrprime||^2+\Ietrprime(\etrprime)
\end{equation}

where $E$ is the material elastic stiffness tensor, $\varepsilon$ is the total strain, $\etr$ is the total transformation strain, $\etrprime$ is the deviatoric transformation strain, $C$ is the material parameter, $\tau_M(T)$ is a positive monotonically increasing function based on $C(T-\Tref)$, $T$ is the temperature, $\Tref$ is the reference temperature, $H$ is a material parameter related to the hardening of the material during phase transformation and $\Ietrprime(\etrprime)$ is an indicator function that satisfies the constraint on the transformation norm based on \cite{auricchioImprovementsAlgorithmicalConsiderations2002}. From this, the stress $\sigma$ and transformation strain $X_\mathrm{tr}$ can be deduced as :
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fem-stress-transf-stress}
    \sigma = \frac{\delta\Psi}{\delta\varepsilon},~X_\mathrm{tr}\in-\frac{\delta\Psi}{\delta\etrprime}
\end{equation}

In order to model the shape memory effect of the alloy, a customised material is described by initialising the material data table in \textit{ANSYS}. The shape memory effect option is defined by the density, the Young's modulus in the A phase, the Poisson's ratio and seven material constants as described in \cref{tab:fem-parameters}. These define the stress-strain behaviour of the alloy during the loading and unloading cycles and during thermal loading. These parameters can be obtained from the suppliers or using experimental data from literature as shown in the work by \cite{malagisiCoupledNormalshearStress2017}.

\begin{table}[hbt]
    \centering
    \caption[The definitions of the parameters used to define the SME in the commercial FEM software, ANSYS]{The definitions of the parameters used to define the SME in the commercial FEM software, ANSYS (based on the work by \cite{jaberAnsysParametersShape2018}).}
    \label{tab:fem-parameters}
    \input{images/chap2/fem-parameters-table.tex}
\end{table}

The shape memory effect is defined by the stress-strain curves based on the different mechanical and thermal loading cycles as shown in \cref{fig:fem-wp-graph}. Each parameter defined within the material data within the FEM software has an effect on the curves. The effect of each parameter has been described and explored in the work by \cite{jaberAnsysParametersShape2018}. Furthermore, the various material parameters used in the material data table can be defined by their relationship to the critical transformation stress and temperatures as shown below. The hardening parameter, $H$, as defined below, defines the change in the slope of the $\sigma-\varepsilon$ curve during the detwinning process.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fem-h}
    H = \frac{\sigmafamplus-\sigmasamplus}{\frac{\sigmafamplus}{E_M}+\eL-\frac{\sigmasamplus}{E_A}}
\end{equation}

Here, the superscript $+$ and $-$ represent whether the material is loaded in tension or compression respectively. Furthermore, the superscript $MA$ and $AM$ represent the transformation from the M to the A phase and vice versa. Lastly, the subscript $\mathrm{s}$ and $\mathrm{f}$ represent the start and finish thresholds. The temperature scaling parameter is defined, as defined in \cref{eq:fem-C}, and is shown in \cref{fig:fem-wp-graph} by the relationship between the transformation temperature and stress.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fem-C}
    C = C^{AM}=C^{MA}=\frac{\sigmafmaplus}{T_\mathrm{ref}-\Af}
\end{equation}

In most constitutive models, the SMA behaves symmetrically in tension and compression. However, numerous experimental tests show that there is an asymmetrical behaviour between the two and in this model, the lode dependency parameter, $\beta$, as defined below, takes into account this asymmetry.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fem-beta}
    \beta = \frac{|\sigmasamminus|-\sigmasamplus}{|\sigmasamminus|+\sigmasamplus}
\end{equation}

Using the FEM simulations of the SMA, complex structures composed of the alloy can be used to predict the behaviour of the SME when the thermal load is applied. This strategy can be used to estimate the force requirements when sizing the biasing elements and the stroke output of the overall actuator when activated. However, the computation time of the simulation can be high and thus, using this strategy to optimise designs might not be feasible. Using the one-dimensional analytical models validated by the FEM simulations can be effective in designing SMA actuators in most cases.

\section{Stroke Estimation of SMA Actuators}\label{sec:stroke-estimation}
As the biasing element plays a major role in the operation of the SMA actuator, the first step in estimating the stroke and force characteristics of the actuator consists of determining the force-displacement profile of the biasing element. In this section, the biasing element is considered to be a linear spring as this is the most common type of SMA actuator implementation. However, this methodology can be applied to any biasing element as soon as its behaviour has been modelled. With the help of \cref{eq:f-x-sma} and the dimensions of the SMA, such as the cross-section area of the SMA, $A_\mathrm{SMA}$, and the length of the SMA, $L_\mathrm{SMA}$, the stress-strain characteristics of the SMA can be converted into the required force-displacement profile used to compare with the biasing element. In the case of a linear spring with stiffness, $K_\mathrm{BS}$, \cref{eq:bias-spring} can be used to obtain the relevant force-displacement curve of the biasing spring.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:f-x-sma}
    F = A_\mathrm{SMA}\sigma,~x = L_\mathrm{SMA}\varepsilon
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:bias-spring}
    \sigma A_\mathrm{SMA} = -K_\mathrm{BS}\left(L_\mathrm{SMA}\varepsilon-x_\mathrm{off}\right)
\end{equation}
% SMA - Bias spring diagram with variables
\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth]{images/chap2/bias-spring-diagram.pdf}
    \caption{A schematic representation of the Bias-spring SMA actuator showing the different variables and the stroke estimation based on the SMA temperature.}
    \label{fig:bias-spring-diagram}
\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:bias-spring-diagram}, the schematic of a standard bias-spring SMA actuator shows the simplified operating principle of the actuator. Here, the SMA and the biasing spring are separated by a distance, $x_\mathrm{off}$, so as to apply the initial pre-stress to the SMA element. This offset allows the SMA to be biased and detwinned at the lower temperatures. As shown in the diagram, when heated, the SMA contracts to a length, $L_\mathrm{SMA}+x_2$, and when cooled, the SMA elongates to a length, $L_\mathrm{SMA}+x_1$. Thus, the stroke of the actuator, $\Delta x$, can be easily deduce by taking the difference between the two lengths, $x_1-x_2$, as shown in the figure.

% Stroke estimation using spring model
The stroke of the bias-spring SMA actuator can be estimated using the \cite{brinsonOneDimensionalConstitutiveBehavior1993} model. Firstly, with a known temperature, $T < \As$, the martensite fraction can be deduced using \cref{eq:brinson_conv_xis} and \cref{eq:brinson_conv_xit}. When substituting $\sigma$ with the bias-spring equation \ref{eq:bias-spring}, a relationship between $\xi$ and $\varepsilon$ can be obtained. This relationship, combined with \cref{eq:brinson_model_3}, the strain, $\varepsilon$, and consequently, the elongation, $x$, of the SMA can be estimated with respect to its temperature, $T$. In most cases, however, the cold state exists completely within the detwinned state and the hot state exists entirely in the A phase so as to maximise the stroke of the SMA actuator. This consideration can simplify the analytical model.

In the case of the cold state, with $T_1 < \Mf$, $\xi_S=1$ and $\xi_T=0$, the elongation of the cold bias-spring SMA actuator, $x_1$ can be estimated as:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:bias-spring-sma-cold-elongation}
    x_1 = \frac{\KBS\xoff-\ASMA(\Omega_S+\Theta(T_1-T_0))}{\frac{\ASMA E_M}{\LSMA}+\KBS}
\end{equation}
Similarly, in the case of the hot state, where the SMA has been completely transformed into the A phase, with $T_2 < \Af$, $\xi=0$, the elongation of the hot bias-spring SMA actuator, $x_2$ can be estimated as:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:bias-spring-sma-hot-elongation}
    x_2 = \frac{\KBS\xoff-\ASMA\Theta(T_1-T_0)}{\frac{\ASMA E_A}{\LSMA}+\KBS}
\end{equation}

    \label{fig:brinson-sma-spring}
\end{figure}

Thus, as stated previously, the stroke of the system can be deduced as $\Delta x = x_1-x_2$ as shown in \cref{fig:brinson-sma-spring}. This graph shows the sizing of an SMA actuator comprised of a 100 $\mu$m SMA wire of length 30 mm and a biasing spring with a spring constant of $3.5$ N/mm separated by a distance of $6$ mm. As presented in the previous equations, the Brinson model has been adapted such that the operating points of the actuator and the stroke can be easily estimated. The material constants, as shown in \cref{tab:brinson-material-properties}, can be obtained from the supplier or using experimental data from literature such as the work by \cite{elahiniaEnhancedSMAPhenomenological2005}. The required forces can be easily obtained by using the spring model described in \cref{eq:bias-spring}. This one-dimensional model can be quite effective when sizing actuators powered by sheets or wires. However, when designing actuators with more complex biasing elements or additional mechanical stages, the analytical models of the system can become quite complicated.

\section{Simplifying the Sizing of the SMA Actuator}\label{sec:simplified-sma-model}
Owing to their high power densities, SMA-based actuators are extensively used in mini- and micro-actuators. However, when considered for applications where high-output forces and strokes are required, they are limited. When under tension in the form of SMA wires, this alloy can generate high forces but can only exert it for up to 8\% of their length. Thus, in many cases where higher strokes are required, these SMA wires are wound into helical springs which allows them to have high strokes but comes at the cost of their output forces.

    \label{fig:sma-coil-curve-fit}
\end{figure}

As stated previously, the one-dimensional model is quite effective at sizing simple SMA-powered systems. However, when employing SMAs in more complex applications, a simpler methodology has been adopted to size these actuators. When dealing with SMA wires, under uniaxial tension, the highly non-linear \cite{brinsonOneDimensionalConstitutiveBehavior1993} model is an accurate tool in sizing the actuator. However, when considering an SMA helical spring, the constitutive models appear more linear in its low temperature state as shown in \cref{fig:sma-coil-curve-fit}. Thus, for most design cases, some experimentally-validated assumptions, as stated in the work by \cite{dragoniDesignDevelopmentAdvanced2021}, can be made such that the material behaviours can be linearised. Here, the stress-strain curves, as shown in \cref{fig:simplied-sma-bias-spring-wp}, can be replaced with straight lines. Here, in this model, the high temperature or Austenitic SMA curve can be replaced with a straight line originating from the centre with a slope of $E_A$ while the low temperature or Martensitic SMA curve can be replaced by a straight line with slope of $E_M$ and offset by $\sigma_0$.

\end{figure}

The A phase of the SMA occurs when the material is heated above its transition temperature, $\Af$, and reverts back to the M phase when the temperature drops back down below the martensitic transition temperature, $\Mf$. However, as shown in \cref{fig:phase-diagram-graph}, there is a relationship between the stress imposed on the alloy and its transition temperatures. This implies that that when sufficiently above a certain critical stress threshold, $\sigma_\mathrm{s}^{AM}$, the A phase SMA will revert back to the M phase reducing the rigidity of the material. As the SMA actuator operates by the change in material rigidity between the high temperature and low temperature phases, this change in rigidity at the critical stress threshold will cause the actuator to have a reduced stroke. Thus, when designing SMA actuators, this maximum stress or force output must be taken into account using \cref{eq:critical-M-stress}. In the case where the biasing element exceeds this critical stress, the final stroke of the material is greatly reduced as the material will be operating within its super-elastic region.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:critical-M-stress}
    \sigma_\mathrm{s}^{AM} = C_M (T-\Ms)
\end{equation}

In this work, SMA helical springs are used due to their availability and their ability to generate large strokes. The material properties were obtained experimentally and by curve-fitting the resulting force-displacement profile. In this case, a PID controller paired with a thermal camera as a feedback is used to maintain the SMA spring at a constant temperature. A pull-tester is used to elongate the spring while measuring the force to obtain the force-displacement profiles at the required constant temperature. These isothermal traction tests are then curve fitted to obtain the material properties in the M and A phases. Finally, these simplified curves can be used to size the SMA-powered actuators.

While the behaviour of the shape memory effect in these springs is still non-linear, the simplified linearised curves can be used to obtain the operating points of SMA actuators as shown in \cref{fig:simplied-sma-bias-spring-wp}. These experimental results show that the simplified curves are able to quite accurately depict the force-displacement behaviours of SMA helical springs. In the following chapters, the force-displacement profiles obtained from the experimental results have been used to size the various SMA-based actuators.

This methodology of using the respective hot and cold force-displacement profiles is a useful approach to sizing and characterizing an SMA actuator. However, when multi-output systems are employed and kinematic stages with complex behaviours are integrated, this methodology must be appropriately adapted so as to accurately size the active SMA element and predict the actuator stroke. In the following chapters, this simplified methodology is adapted and employed in the sizing of more complex and integrated SMA-powered actuators.

\section{Summary and Conclusion}
In this chapter, the thermomechanical behaviour referred to as the shape memory effect has been presented and modelled. Various modelling strategies, such as finite element modelling and analytical modelling, are presented. The models have been used in the scope of predicting the shape memory effect such that actuators powered by these SMAs can be adequately and accurately sized. In the context of traditional SMA actuators, the models have been adapted and described so as to present the traditional design methodology often employed in SMA-based actuators such as the ones presented in \cref{chap:sma-actuator-design}.

The SME occurs due to various microscopic structure changes that occurs during phase transformations as the alloy is subjected to a thermal load. In the first section, the different phase transformations and crystal structure changes are presented and described. By taking into account the presence of different phases and phase transformations, the requirements and conditions required by the SME cycle is presented and described.

In the context of predicting the SME, the \cite{liangConstitutiveModelingShape1990a} analytical model is presented. This 1-dimensional phenomenological model has been able to provide some constitutive equations that describes the transformation of the alloy between the high temperature A phase and the low temperature M phase. This model, widely used in traditional SMA actuator design, has been presented in this chapter. However, this model does not take into account the low rigidity and highly elastic nature of the SMA at low temperatures. The \cite{brinsonOneDimensionalConstitutiveBehavior1993} model, on the other hand, has taken into account the stress induced detwinning process into the phenomenological model and has allowed the model to accurately describe the thermomechanical behaviour of the SMA at low temperatures.

Furthermore, in this chapter, the modelling of SMAs and its shape memory effect using commercial FEM softwares is presented. These softwares make use of the \cite{auricchioRobustIntegrationalgorithmFinitestrain2001} equations to accurately model the 3-dimensional behaviour of the alloy when subjected to thermal and mechanical loading. The FEM models have enabled designers to predict the behaviour of the SMAs in cases with more complex geometries and in scenarios where the 1D \cite{brinsonOneDimensionalConstitutiveBehavior1993} models are not sufficient. Furthermore, the various material properties required to define the FEM material model has been showcased.

Using the constitutive equations presented in this chapter, the sizing methodology of the SMA actuators are displayed. Using the \cite{brinsonOneDimensionalConstitutiveBehavior1993} model, the stroke of a commonly used biased-spring SMA actuator is estimated. This adapted model, shown in this chapter, uses the change in rigidity between the two phases of the alloy and the force-displacement profiles of the biasing elements to establish operating points for the actuator based on the temperature of the active element. This methodology allows an accurate sizing of the biasing spring and active SMA element such that the resulting actuator can be designed for any application or scenario. The accurate sizing of the SMA allows employing the smallest and most efficient SMA elements so as to create an actuator that has a compact footprint and a high bandwidth.

In many cases, the highly non-linear nature of the SMA renders the sizing of the SMA actuator quite difficult and computational expensive. Furthermore, in the case of SMA helical springs, the resulting force-displacement curve used in the sizing methodology can be linearised without losing too much accuracy in the stroke estimation. This simplified linear model can be extrapolated to other SMA-based actuators so as to obtain a relatively simple sizing methodology that can be used to estimate in the stroke in the various types of simple SMA actuators.

In the case of SMA-powered actuators where the biasing element or the active element are more complex or perform multiple roles using the same structure, this traditional design methodology must be adapted. In the following chapters, this work focuses on adapting the traditional design methodology such that the same principle can be implemented in cases where the actuator has been highly integrated. Furthermore, the chapters focus on adapting the methodology such that more complex active and biasing elements can be employed while still being able to accurately size each subsystem.
