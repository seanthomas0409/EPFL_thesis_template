\chapter{Validation with Novel SMA Robotic Systems}
In this final chapter, the novel design methodology is validated using 3 different case studies. These case studies employ the strategies and analytical models presented in chapter \ref{chap:design-methodology}. While validating the different analytical models, these case studies also validate the basic premise of the methodology.
