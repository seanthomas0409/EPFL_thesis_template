\section{Validation using a Case Study: A Multi-Output SMA Mandrel}\label{sec:smacm-mandrel}
\subsection{Motivation and Background}
As previously stated, Shape Memory Alloys exhibit a relatively high volumetric work density. Thus, they are an ideal candidate in created lightweight actuators for applications where reducing the total weight of the system drastically improves the efficiency such as drone deliveries. Here, any reduced weight increases the total flight time of the drone and thus, makes it the ideal use case of lightweight SMA actuators.
In the context of drone deliveries, grippers generally consist of an actuator such as a motor and kinematic stage that converts the motion of the actuator into a gripping motion. In certain scenarios, the required gripping motion can be complex consisting of multiple outputs and radial movements such as gripper implemented in \todocite (iris gripper).
In this case study, the goal is to apply the design methodology presented in this chapter to fabricate a drone-ready gripper with an advanced gripping mechanism. Using compliant mechanisms generated by topology optimization, an advanced kinematic stage can be designed to convert the motion of the SMA actuator into a multi-output gripping motion. Based on the design approach, the multi-output SMA gripper is sized and fabricated so as to validate the methodology.
\subsection{Working Principle of the Gripper}
The working principle of the proposed SMA gripper is based on the traditional SMA actuator presented in \cref{chap:sma-actuator-design} adapted by the design methodology described in \cref{chap:design-methodology}. Here, the gripper consists of a simple SMA coil that acts as the active element and an accompanying compliant structure that behaves as the kinematic stage and as the biasing element.

The active SMA coil is prestretched by the biasing element at low temperature and contracts when heated above its transition temperature. The biasing element, which also acts as a conversion mechanism to transform the linear actuation of the SMA coil into a gripper movement, exhibits an inherent stiffness due to the fact that it composed of flexure-based hinges. As the SMA cools down, a spring force acts on the coil due to the stiffness of the compliant mechanism. When heating the SMA, the contraction of the coil deforms the compliant biasing element creating the desired gripping motion at the output. By controlling the temperature of the SMA coil, the entire system can be made to grip and release objects.

In this application, the SMA coil is heating using Joule's heating by applying a constant voltage across it. This simple solution makes use of the internal resistance of the SMA coil to exploit the Joule's losses when passing a current through it to raise the temperature of the material. The coil, here, is cooled using passive cooling by simple convection with the surrounding air. This standard solution allows for a simple control system that does not require any external heating system which would add weight to the system. Furthermore, an H-bridge is used to supply the current and control the heating of the SMA coil. Finally, as precise control of the system is required, a hall-effect sensor or any other low profile position sensor can be used to detect the state of the gripper.

  \caption{The sizing methodology of the biased-compliant SMA gripper based on the proposed designing methodology.}
  \label{fig:mandrel-gripperwp}
\end{figure}

The working principle can be further visualised using the simplified sizing graphs presented in \cref{subsec:passive-biasing-compliant-mech} as shown in \todocite. The SMA coil within the gripper operates between the ambient temperature and a temperature above its transition temperature. This behaviour, as mentioned previously, can be simplified into two straight lines based on its temperature. It is important to note that there exists a locus of lines representing the SMA at every temperature in between. Based on the methodology, the operating point of the gripper can be deduced using the intersection of the SMA curves and the characteristic of the designed biasing element. This characteristic will be described and validated in the following sections. The operating points are labelled in the figure as \circled{1} and \circled{2}. The maximum possible stroke of the gripper can be estimated by taking the difference between the x-values of the two operating points, $x_1-x_2$. However, the variable, $x_\mathrm{off}$, represents the distance between the SMA and the biasing-element before they are prestretched and attached to each other. These operating points described represent the behaviour of the gripper without a payload. In the case a payload, is present, the behaviour of the gripper and the gripping force is dependant on the size of the payload, $x_\mathrm{Obj}$. This behaviour of the payload can be simplified as a perfectly rigid object with an infinite stiffness. Thus, the intersection between the force-displacement curve of the payload and the high temperature SMA will deduce the last operating point \circled{3}. The gripping force, $F_\mathrm{Grip}$, experienced by the payload can be estimated using this last operating point as shown in the figure. Thus, as established by the design methodology presented in \cref{chap:design-methodology}, the curves of the SMA and the compliant mechanism can be used to estimate the total stroke and gripping force of the system, as represented by $x_1-x_2$ and $F_\mathrm{Grip}$ respectively.
\subsection{Designing the Integrated Biased Kinematic Stage}
The main goal of the design presented in this section is to create a multi-output gripper actuated using a single SMA coil. When designing grippers with complex outputs such as the work shown in \todocite, multiple active elements are used. The goal of this design is to improve these grippers by implementing an integrated system that can present multi-output gripping motion while only using a single SMA coil as an input. Here, the design is based on the 4-Point Mandrel topology presented in \cref{chap:compliant-sma}. However, here, the structure is used as the passive element as opposed to the active element proposed in the following chapter. Thus, in this gripper design, the 4-prong radial compliant mechanism is used as the passive biasing element and as the kinematic stage. Furthermore, the compliant mechanism is redesigned using flexure-based hinges so as to improve the stroke of the gripper system. Here, as the topology is limited to the 2D plane, the flexural mechanism is further improved by extending the design space to a 2.5D design, which involved stacking 2D structures along the third dimension.
\subsubsection{Articulated Parallelogram Core and Analytical Geometry Approach}
The algorithmically generated mandrel topology consists of an articulated symmetrical parallelogram (rhombus). The topology can be reduced to four identical triangles joined at one vertex by a pivot as shown in \cref{fig:mandrel-kinematic}(a). The kinematics of the design is adapted from the generated one by using hinges instead of distributed deformation. In the figure, the blue arrows represent the input while the black arrows represent the output. The design has been generated such that the SMA coils can be placed at the inputs so as to generate a radial output towards the centre when actuated.

\begin{figure}[t] % t for top of the page, H could be put to impose the position of the float
  \centering
  \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\input{images/chap7/mandrel-kinematic-stage.tex}}
  \caption{Kinematic diagram of proposed design where the black dots represent ideal pivots, the blue and black arrows represent the input and output displacement, respectively. On the left: the outward-triangle configuration with a) the initial position and b) the displaced one. On the right-hand side: the inward-triangle configuration achieving a stroke amplification with c) the initial position and d) the displaced one. e) represents mandrel topology generated with 2D topology optimization which behaves similarly to the outward version. f) shows the 2.5D adaptation of the inward version into a flexure-based mechanism distributed over multiple layers, and with a reversed actuation direction.}
  \label{fig:mandrel-kinematic}
\end{figure}

When examining the concept behind the mandrel mechanism, the conclusion can be made that the driving structure consists of four right-angled isosceles triangles which represent the four claws of the mandrel. Furthermore, the pivots, being constrained along the horizontal and vertical axes due to symmetry, force the outputs to move along a $45^{\circ}$ path. However, upon careful examination, these constraints can be satisfied in two distinct configurations as shown in \cref{fig:mandrel-kinematic}(a) and (c). The four triangles can be position inwardly or outwardly. Due to the inward-facing configuration having overlapping triangles, this topology cannot be generated from a 2D design space. The main advantage of the inward-facing configuration compared to the outward-facing configuration is the stroke amplification of the output vertices based on the stroke of the SMA coil contraction. It is also important to note that the direction of the radial output depends on the direction of the input displacement. Thus, the gripper can be made to open or close when the SMA coil is heated. By attaching the SMA coil to the vertical pivots rather than the horizontal ones, the gripper can be made to be always opened or always closed.

\subsubsection{Determining the Relationship between the Hinges and the SMA Stroke}
The stroke amplification, $\gamma$, of the system is not uniform and is dependant on the position of the mechanism, $x$. This amplification factor can be described by deriving the output vertex position, $R$, with respect to the input vertex position, $x$, and can be expressed analytically as :
\begin{equation}
\gamma(x) = \frac{\partial R(x)}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\left(1-\text{sign}(\alpha)\frac{x}{\sqrt{L_{h}^2-\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2}} \right)
\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    R(x) &= L_{h}\cos\left(\theta(x) - \alpha\right)\\
     &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\frac{x}{2} +\text{sign}(\alpha) \sqrt{L_{h}^2-\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2}\right),
    \label{eq:7}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with,
\begin{equation}
\theta(x) = \arccos{\left(\frac{x}{2L_{h}}\right)} \quad \text{and} \quad \alpha=\pm\frac{\pi}{4}.
\label{eq:theta}
\end{equation}
Here, $L_h$ represents the length of the hypotenuse of each triangle, $\theta$ represents the angle between the horizontal and the hypotenuse, $\alpha$ represents the angle between the hypotenuse and the side of the triangle and can equal a value of $\pm\frac{\pi}{4}$. This angle is defined as positive for the outward-facing configuration and as negative for the inward-facing one. Here, the output stroke is majorly dependant on the sign of the angle $\alpha$. The outward configuration has a stroke amplification of less than one for almost all possible inputs, implying a stroke reduction. While, on the other hand, the inward configuration has a stroke amplification large than one. In the context of a gripper, the inward version was chosen for its larger output stroke.

\subsubsection{Simple Kinematics to a Compliant Mechanism}
The kinematic schematic is composed of only simple hinges and rigid links. This makes it the ideal candidate for implementation using flexure-based hinges. In this case, as shown in \cref{fig:mech_stages}, truncated semi-circular flexure hinges were selected for their ability to avoid high localised stress concentration and allow for an acceptable angular stroke as displayed in the work by \todocite.

\begin{figure}[t] % t for top of the page, H could be put to impose the position of the float
  \centering
  \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\input{images/chap7/mandrel-mech-stages.tex}}
  \caption{Different views of the flexure-based compliant mechanism spreading over multiple stages, and parametrized flexure pivot.}
  \label{fig:mech_stages}
\end{figure}

As stated earlier, the inward-facing triangle configuration was chosen and due to fact that the triangles overlap during actuation, it makes it impossible to be implemented in a 2D design space. Thus, as shown in \cref{fig:mech_stages}, a 2.D design approach was implemented where each overlapping triangle is stacked in the 3\textsuperscript{rd} dimension. The mechanism is distributed among different superimposed layers linked at the vertices of the triangle to replicated the kinematic schematic. This adaptation to 2.5D design does not impact the functionality of the mechanism as long as the hinges are considered infinitely rigid when bending in any other direction other than the desired one. Here, two layers are implemented to accommodate the four triangles : the $L_1$ stage comprising of the green and orange triangles, and the $L_2$ stage comprising of the pink and blue triangles.

In the case of the ideal kinematic schematic, the triangles are attached at a single point to form a parallelogram. However, this is difficult to implement with a flexure-based solution due to the rigid links having a non-null width. This adds unwanted links and hinges to the kinematic chain which results in undesired Degrees of Freedom (DoF). This parasitic DoF is overcome by adding a third DoF-inhibiting stage, $L_3$, to the 2.5D design as shown in \cref{fig:mech_stages}.

As the goal of this gripper is for drone delivery purposes, another stage, which behaves as the frame of the drone, can be added to the design. For mechanism to behave as intended in the kinematic schematic, the left and right input vertices must be constraint to move along a single line. In this case, for simplicity, this constraint has been implemented using a rail. For a future drone mounted setup, an additional stage can be added to perform this required constraint, showing the advantage of the 2.5D design approach.

\subsubsection{Sizing of the Biasing Compliant Mechanism}
Based on the proposed design methodology, the goal of the mechanism is to create a kinematic stage that also behaves as the passive biasing element for the SMA coil. The inherent stiffness of the overall compliant mechanism due to the flexural hinges is harness to prestretch the SMA for activation. Thus, in order to size the actuator and the corresponding biasing element, an analytical model of the stiffness must be developed. Using the pseudo-rigid model, as presented in the work by \cite{heneinConceptionStructuresArticulees2005}, the flexural hinges can be considered as torsional spring with a constant angular stiffness, $K_\theta$. As detailed in \cref{subsec:passive-biasing-compliant-mech}, the stiffness of the compliant structure requires an expression for the relationship between angular position of the flexural hinge and the contraction of the SMA, $\theta(\Delta x)$. In this case, this relationship can be expressed as :
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mandrel-theta-model}
\theta(\Delta x) = \arccos{\left(\frac{\Delta x}{2L_{h}} + \cos(\theta_0)\right)},
\end{equation}
with $\theta_0$ being the resting angle at which the mechanism is printer/fabricated as shown in \cref{fig:mandrel-kinematic}(f).

As detailed in the methodology, the next step is to calculate the potential energy within the system during deformation. Due to the symmetry of the mechanism, all the hinges store the same potential energy. Here, the $L_3$ stage has 8 hinges while the stages $L_1$ and $L_2$ have 4 hinges each. Thus, the total potential energy of the whole mechanism is :
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mandrel-potential-energy-model}
U_\mathrm{tot}(\Delta x) = 16\cdot U(\Delta x)
\end{equation}
The force-displacement characteristic of the mechanism is then given by :
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mandrel-force-model}
\begin{split}
    F(\Delta x) &= \lVert -\nabla{U_\text{tot}(\Delta x)}\rVert = \frac{\partial U_\text{tot}(\Delta x)}{\partial \Delta x}\\
     &= \frac{8K_{\theta}}{L_{h}}  \frac{(\theta(\Delta x)-\theta_{0})}{\sin(\theta(\Delta x))}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The resulting characteristic is plotted as shown in \cref{fig:mandrel-am-expt-compare}. Furthermore, the model is validated using experimental results obtained using a pull-tester. As the experimental results follow the model quite closely, it validates the working hypothesis and approximations used during the definition of the analytical model.

  \resizebox{0.7\textwidth}{!}{\input{images/chap7/am-expt-compare.pgf}}
  \caption{Validation of the analytical model of the biasing compliant mechanism using experimental results obtained using a pull-tester. Here, the small discrepency arises due to the creep present in the plastic structure as the mechanism returns to its original shape.}
  \label{fig:mandrel-am-expt-compare}
\end{figure}
As the force characteristic flattens unlike a traditional linear spring, the operating points of the actuator will offer higher strokes for a given SMA coil. Furthermore, as the curve also decreases in value near the low-temperature operating point \circled{1}, its implies that the gripper can exert higher gripping forces for objects with a larger diameter. This shows that the current force-displacement characteristic of the proposed compliant mechanism is well suited as a biasing element in an SMA actuator. Finally, in the figure, some plastic deformation can be observed as the mechanism was deformed beyond above its admissible range during the test. The flexural hinges exhibit a limited angular stroke which is one of the limitations of such a design. However, the maximal admissible angle before permanent plastic deformation can be estimated using the work by \cite{heneinConceptionStructuresArticulees2005} as :
\begin{equation}\label{eq:adm-theta-theory}
\Delta\theta_\text{adm} \cong \frac{3\pi\sigma_\text{adm}\sqrt{r}}{4E\sqrt{e}},
\end{equation}
which in this context can be expressed :
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \Delta x_{\text{adm},+} = 2L_{h}\left(\cos(\theta_0+\Delta\theta_\text{adm})-\cos(\theta_0)\right)\\
    \Delta x_{\text{adm},-} = 2L_{h}\left(\cos(\theta_0-\Delta\theta_\text{adm}) - \cos(\theta_0)\right)
    \label{eq:adm}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
If $\mathbb{X}_\text{eq} = \{ x \;|\;  x_{2}\leqslant x \leqslant x_{1}\}$ is the set of possible operating points (see \cref{fig:mandrel-gripperwp}) and $\mathbb{X}_\text{el} =  \{ x \; | \; x_\text{off} + \Delta x_{\text{adm},+} \leqslant x \leqslant x_\text{off} + \Delta x_{\text{adm},-} \}$ is the set of admissible positions for elastic deformation as portrayed in equation \cref{eq:adm} and \cref{fig:mandrel-gripperwp}. Then, based on the design methodology presented in \cref{chap:design-methodology}, the set of feasible operating points for the actuator $\mathbb{X}_\text{f}$ is given by their intersection:
\begin{equation}
   \mathbb{X}_\text{f} = \mathbb{X}_\text{eq} \cap \mathbb{X}_\text{el}.
\end{equation}
One of the goals of the sizing methodology for the compliant mechanism is to maximise the output stroke while avoiding permanent deformation during operation. Thus, the compliant mechanism must be sized such that $\mathbb{X}_\text{eq} \subseteq \mathbb{X}_\text{el}$. This eliminates the need for precise temperature and positional control of the SMA coil during activation to protect the flexural hinges.

In this case, the output stroke of the gripper can be maximised by maximising the size $\mathbb{X}_\text{f}$ or by having the operating points be located at positions where the curve of the stroke amplification is high (from eq. \cref{eq:1}). A trade-off exists as displacing $\mathbb{X}_\text{f}$ for higher stroke amplification tends to reduce the overall size. Based on \cref{tab:sma-pt-tradeoffs}, various additional trade-offs for the proposed mandrel can be observed as summarised in \cref{tab:mandrel-tradeoffs}.

\begin{table}[hbt!]
    \centering
    \caption{Additional trade-offs observed when sizing the flexural compliant mechanism actuated by a given SMA wire or coil. Here, $S_{\text{mech}}$ and $t_{\text{mech}}$ are the surface area and the thickness of the entire compliant mechanism, respectively.}
    \label{tab:mandrel-tradeoffs}
    \input{images/chap7/mandrel-tradeoffs.tex}
\end{table}

As seen in the table, an optimal solution can be estimated based on the design parameters. However, in the case of $L_h$ and $b$, increasing them will always result in an increased stroke while increasing the overall size of the mechanism. This shows that there exists a trade-off between the weight/size and the output stroke which will be critical to ascertain based on the gripper specifications.

\subsection{Implementation and Experimental Results}
One of the main advantages of this integrated design is the simplicity of fabrication and assembly. The entire compliant structure is printed from Nylon (PA 2200 Polyamide 12) using selective laser sintering (SLS) as shown in \cref{fig:mandrel-finalproto}. As the mechanism consists of stacked layers, the entire structure was printed as a single piece validating the simplicity of the novel design approach.

\begin{figure}[hbt!]

    \resizebox{0.9\textwidth}{!}{\input{images/chap7/mandrel-final-proto.tex}}
    \caption{The working prototype of the biased-compliant SMA gripper (a) opened configuration with a $0.2$mm wire diameter SMA coil (framed in red), (b) closed configuration grasping an object.}
    \label{fig:mandrel-finalproto}
\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:mandrel-stroke-estimation}, the validated analytical models are plotted against the force-displacement curves of the SMA coil. This SMA model was estimated using experimental setup where the SMA coil was maintained at a constant temperature using a PID control and a thermal camera, and was then experimentally tested using the pull-tester. With the experimental data, a simplified linear model of the cold and hot SMAs were determined using linear regression. Using these analytical models and the sizing methodology detailed in \cref{subsec:passive-biasing-compliant-mech}, the stroke of the final mandrel gripper can be estimated. In this prototype, the design parameters used are $e=0.5$ mm, $r=15$ mm, $b=4$ mm, $L_h=42.4$ mm, $x_\text{off}=27.5$ mm and $\theta_0 = \frac{\pi}{8}$. Here, an estimated linear output stroke of up to $4.5$ mm is observed for each claw.

  \caption{The sizing diagram of the SMA mandrel based on the developed analytical model of the compliant mechanism and the models of the SMA coils obtained from experimental results. Here, based on the estimations a maximum stroke of $4.5$ mm is observed.}
  \label{fig:mandrel-stroke-estimation}
\end{figure}

The gripping force, however, is dependant on the size of the gripped object. For an object of diameter close to $x_1$, the gripping force will be maximal. Using a pair of load cells attached to two opposing claws, the gripping force was measured as shown in \cref{fig:mandrel-forcesetup}. The load cells were placed at different distances from the claws to simulated objects of varying sizes. The results of the gripping force measurements can be seen in \cref{fig:mandrel-force-temp}. The gripper shows a force close to constant for large span of SMA temperatures above its transition temperature of 80\degreeC. This constant force behaviour is ideal for a gripper and greatly simplifies the control, preventing any unintended damage to the gripped object. A maximum steady-state force of $1.78$ N was measured for the biggest payload size while using the smallest available SMA coil, whose wire diameter is $0.2$ mm. While this result is promising, it should be noted that the fabricated prototype is sub-optimal and can be further optimised for greater forces, either by optimising the compliant mechanism or by using thicker SMA coils. Increasing the wire diameter of the SMA coil comes with higher gripping forces but comes at the cost of slower cooling time or increased time delay between the opening and closing sequence of the gripper.

  \label{fig:mandrel-force-temp}
\end{figure}

In the end, the final prototype, as seen in \cref{fig:mandrel-finalproto}, was measured to weigh only $17$ g, which implies that the gripper has a maximum force-density of around $105$ N/kg. This shows that proposed mandrel gripper can be ideal for lightweight applications such as drone deliveries. Furthermore, this demonstrates the highly integrated nature of the gripper, thus, validating the design methodology presented in \cref{chap:design-methodology}.
