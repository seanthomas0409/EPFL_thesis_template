% Introduction to miniaturisation and Actuators
In the recent decades, there has been a wave of technological progress due to the advancements in miniaturisation. This trend to create smaller and more efficient devices has led to giant leaps in technological advancement. This era of miniaturisation, often referred to as the Second Industrial Revolution, was sparked by the creation of the integrated circuit. The exponential scaling and miniaturisation of silicon transistors has led to computers, filling entire rooms, being transformed into handheld devices that fit in one's pockets. This trend has allowed electronics to have faster performance, lower power consumption and be cheaper than its predecessor. This translates to market share as well as miniaturisation has given a competitive edge to technological and commercial products over its competitors. This age of miniaturisation has not been restricted to electronics but has also impact mechanical and optical devices. Motors, sensors and other such devices have all gone through the same trend in reduce footprint and increase performances resulting in a market where miniature actuators and sensors are readily available for relatively low prices.

% Introduction to Smart materials
The basic component of any robotic system is the actuator which is responsible for moving and controlling the system. The principle behind creating miniature robotics systems, thus, consists of downsizing actuators. The design and sizing criteria for actuators can not be necessarily applied from the macro scale when downsizing. However, the primary agent for the miniaturization of actuators has been the proliferation of Smart Materials. These materials, often referred to as artificial muscles, are able to provide some form of work as a response to a certain stimulus such as stress, an electric or magnetic field. The reactive nature of these materials allows them to be used as actuators or sensors in creating compact and integrated actuators. These materials can be integrated and tailored to fit within a certain use case based on the physical requirements of the application. These applications can range from micro-grippers, biomimetic robots to crawling robots as shown in figure \cref{fig:smart-actuator-examples}.

% Shape memory alloys and its high work density
The choice of smart material depends on a range of parameters notably the activation stimulus, the time response, and its work density. When considering miniaturisation and creating actuators for compact and lightweight systems, the work density is often used as the leading parameter in choosing the smart material. As shown in \cref{fig:smart-material-comparison}, among most smart materials, the material, that presents with the highest work density and is, thus, the primary candidate for miniature actuators, is the Shape Memory Alloy (SMA). These alloys, often composed on Nickel and Titanium, is a brand of smart material that reacts to temperature. Variants of these alloys that react to a magnetic field are also present. But the thermoelastic variant of the shape memory alloys are more widely used and can be obtained in different shapes and sizes. There are different varieties of the thermally activated SMAs but the alloy that is the most widely available is the Nickel-Titanium alloy, often known as NiTiNOL. The properties of the material can be changed by modifying the atomic percentages of the alloy or by doping the alloy with other metals.

% Examples of SMA applications and its fields
\section*{Design Considerations}
As stated, due to the high work density of the material, SMAs are generally used in applications where low weight and a compact footprint is required. However, as observed in the \cref{fig:smart-material-comparison}, the requirement to heat the active element, results in SMAs having relatively low time responses. Cooling, when executed passively, results in extended waiting time before the repeated actuation of the SMA actuator. This results in the material being primarily used in systems that do not require high bandwidths. However, when downsizing the actuator, the volume-to-surface area ratio increases, resulting in faster cooling times. Thus, SMAs are often used in applications such as micro-actuators and grippers. Furthermore, due to the bio-compatible nature of the alloy, they have been used in biomedical applications for smart catheters and minimally invasive surgery robots. Recently, there has also been a surge of work done where SMAs are used in create autonomous, walking robots and self-reconfigurable robots. All of these applications require actuators that have high work outputs while remaining light and compact. Thus, SMAs have become an ideal candidate for these use cases.

% Commonality of such actuators (common design parameters)
As the commonality in these application is the limitations in space and weight, the design specification of the required actuators often take into account the final weight and size of the system. These SMAs are able to return to revert back to their original shape when heated. This behaviour, often referred to as the Shape Memory Effect (SME), is exploited to create these actuators. After some deformation alters its shape, this behaviour simply alloys the active element to perform some work when heated. This, these SMA actuators requires various transmission stages and sensors when implemented for a certain application. Thus, as SMA actuator are required to output more work while staying compact, the implementation of such actuators take into consideration how the final work density is affected by the additional of these external components. Due to the strengths of the SMA with regards to its work density, the main design consideration taken into account is the design of these external components and the minimisation of the extra weight and volume added to the overall actuator.

% Challenges of designing SMA actuators
SMA actuators when implementing into compact system result in noiseless operation and their high force-to-weight ratio and muscle-like actuation make them suitable for soft robotics and biomimetic/bio-inspired robots. However, as previously mentioned, they have small bandwidth and low operating frequencies, primarily due to their large cooling times. As explored in the work by \cite{sootherChallengesPracticalApplications2020}, this poses the principle challenge when designing SMA actuators. Furthermore, the force output of SMAs are relatively low and this is, often, counteracted by using bundles of SMA wires. However, by increasing the volume of SMAs also increase the cooling time and further decreases the operating frequency, creating a trade-off between the two parameters. Finally, the shape memory effect and the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the SMA is highly non-linear and complex. This makes the actuators difficult to control and requires special methods and sensors to control them.

When combined, these factors make the design of SMA actuators and their integration into complex applications difficult and cumbersome. Due to the various trade-offs that exists when designing the active element, accurate sizing of the actuator is critical to optimize the final footprint and weight of the system. When volume and weight constraints are present, a holistic design approach is required where the entire system and the actuator is considered in the design process. Due to the complex nature of the smart material and the sometimes complex nature of the application, the sizing of the active element becomes difficult and results in a system that is not fully optimised or is oversized. These concessions in the design process results in a degradation of the overall work density of the SMA actuator.

\section*{Thesis Statement}
% Design Problems
In this thesis, the main goal of the work is to explore, develop and demonstrate novel holistic approaches to creating highly integrated SMA-powered actuators. As shape memory alloys are known for their high work density, they are primarily used in applications where lightweight and compact actuators are a necessity. In this work, the traditional SMA design methodology are studied and adapted to improve their work density and allow them to harness the full potential of the smart material. In doing so, the work presents various design strategies and analytical models that enable creating integrated systems in a plethora of different use cases.

In this thesis, the main focus of the work is to explore and respond to the following key research questions:

\paragraph{How can the work density degradation of SMAs be prevented when designing actuators?}
As miniaturisation becomes critical in the design of actuators and robotic systems, the need for materials with high work density has increased. SMAs are touted to have the highest work density among most smart materials and are thus, primarily used in scenarios where a lightweight or compact design are a necessity. However, the alloy alone cannot be used to create an actuator and the material various other components to function as an actuator. These additional elements such as a biasing element or a kinematic stage, degrade the work density of the overall actuator by introducing passive elements into the system. One of the primary goals of this work is to explore various strategies a designing can employ to prevent this work density degradation. In exploring the question: \textit{what strategies can be employed in the design of SMA actuators that alloy the material to be used to its full potential?}, the work hopes to develop a design methodology that can be implemented in any application such that the resulting actuator maximises the work density resulting in a robotic system that is lightweight and compact. In this work, the proposed design strategies are employed in various case studies so as to validate the methodology and create lightweight robotic systems.

\paragraph{How can the traditional sizing methodology be adapted for integrated SMA actuators?}
In most implements, SMA-powered actuators are heating by simply passing a current through the material and relying on Joule's losses to raise its temperature. However, when cooling the material so as to return the alloy back to its original state, most actuators rely simply on the passive thermal exchange with the surrounding air. This often results in a low bandwidth for the final system. When relying solely on passive cooling, the most critical design parameter to consider becomes the geometry and size of the active SMA element. Here, decreasing the diameter or thickness of the SMA wire / sheet can drastically reduce the cooling time and thus, drastically increase the bandwidth of the final system. Thus, when designing SMA-powered actuators, appropriately sizing the SMA is key to creating a fast and responsive actuator. In the traditional SMA design, simplified sizing strategies exist that alloy creating the perfect balance between the size and force output of the active element. However, when designing more complex and highly integrated SMA systems, this work aims to adapt the tradition sizing strategies to fit the proposed design methodologies. In this work, the various case studies that validate the novel methodologies implement the proposed sizing strategies such that the resulting robotic system employs the smallest active element and results in a system that can be rapidly cooled using passive means.

\paragraph{Can a generative design approach be used to create and validate compliant SMA structures?}
With the recent improvements in the field of additive manufacturing, this has allowed the fabrication of structures with complex geometries. The additive manufacturing of smart materials, especially Ni-Ti based SMAs, has made strides recently. This has made the possibility of 3D printing complex SMA structures a real possibility. However, the question arises: \textit{How can one design a complex SMA structure while taking into account the shape memory effect and predict its resulting behaviour?}. The multi-physical and complex nature of the shape memory effect makes is difficult to accurately predict the behaviour of the alloy when heated which in turn makes it difficult to size and design such active structures. Often, generative algorithms have been used in designing structures when a complex actuation with multiple design constraints are required and where an intuitive design strategy is not feasible. However, due to the highly non-linear nature of the SMA, makes algorithmically generated designs computational expensive resulting in low mesh sizes and domain spaces limited to 2D. In this work, the goal of thesis aims are proposing a strategy to design complex multi-output actuators based on compliant SMA structures so as to harness the potential of the recent advances in additive manufacturing. Furthermore, due to the high computational cost of simulating the shape memory effect, this work aims to present a simple strategy to deduce the feasibility of the generated design as an SMA-powered actuator.

\section*{Thesis Outline and Contributions}
\subsection*{\textsc{Chapter 1}: Overview of SMA Actuator Design}
This chapter provides an overview of the basic and most commonly used implementations of the SMA-powered actuator. Here, a basic overview of the working principle of each type of actuator is presented and described. The three most common methods of implementing the SMA actuator is detailed so as to give an idea of the requirements of an SMA-based actuator. This chapter also delves into the different fields in which this type of actuator is employed. Various examples of SMA-powered robotics systems are studied in each domain so as to understand the different design considerations and parameters that impact the design of SMA-powered actuators. Furthermore, this study allows establishing the basic building blocks present in SMA actuators and understand the functions of each subsystem. Finally, this chapter enables taking a holistic view of the SMA actuator design and establish the drawbacks of the traditional design and the areas in which work density degradation can be reduced.

\subsection*{\textsc{Chapter 2}: Predicting the Shape Memory Effect}
Understanding and predicting the behaviour of the SMA when subjected to a thermal load is critical when designing and sizing SMA-based actuators. In this chapter, the Shape Memory Effect (SME) is introduced and described. Furthermore, the main constitutive models that allow the prediction of the shape memory effect is showcased. The different parameters and multi-physical variables that define the effect in the macro-scale is shown in this chapter. These 1D analytical models are presented as they can be simply implemented and used to size SMA actuators that employ the alloy in simple geometries such as wire and sheets. In scenarios, where more complex geometries are to be simulated, the different parameters required to define the material within a commercial finite element method software is also summarised. Furthermore, in this chapter, these constitutive models are adapted such that they can be employed in sizing the standard bias-spring SMA actuator. Lastly, this chapter presents the traditional simplified sizing methodology used in standard SMA actuator design.

\subsection*{\textsc{Chapter 3}: Development and Modelling of Biased Kinematic Stages for SMA Actuators}
In this chapter, a holistic design approach is presented where the kinematic stage and the biasing element are integrated to further optimize the work density of the final system. Here, the use of flexure-based compliant structures are used to create kinematic stage where the linear motion of the traditional SMA actuator is converted into a more complex desired multi-axial output. The inherent stiffness of the compliant mechanisms, which are generally view as a drawback, is harness to function as the biasing element for the SMA actuator. In this chapter, this novel design methodology is described and the traditional sizing methodology is adapted such that it can be used for any application. Finally, the design and sizing strategy, presented in this chapter, is validated using a case study of a drone-ready SMA-powered gripper.

\subsection*{\textsc{Chapter 4}: Mechanical Approach to SMA Actuator Control}
As SMA are compared to biological muscles due to their high work density, this alloy is often used in bio-inspired applications. In this case, the high work density and lightweight requirement of the robotic application is critical in the design of the SMA actuator. Often, the control electronics and sensors are omitted in the estimation of the work density and this subsystem is one of areas in which the work density is degraded. In this chapter, a mechanically controlled control strategy is proposed that makes use of the thermomechanical effect of the SMA to control itself. In this approach, the mechanically controlled SMA element does not require any sensors or electronics. Here, in this chapter, this control methodology is validated using a lightweight untethered inchworm robot powered by a single SMA helical spring. This chapter describes and models the inchworm robot while also comparing it with other tethered and untethered inchworm robots.

\subsection*{\textsc{Chapter 5}: Generation of Actuators Powered by Compliant SMA Elements}
The advances made in additive manufacturing has allowed the 3D printing of complex geometries fabricated from SMAs. These techniques, while still being expensive and inaccessible has created a need for design tools and strategies for designing complex compliant SMA actuators. In this chapter, the holistic design approach is used to propose a novel design methodology for creating compliant SMA structures that serve as the kinematic stage and as the active element. In this chapter, topology optimization and a simple qualitative comparison factor is present so as to algorithmically design compliant SMA structures while also being able to determine their feasibility in the context of an SMA-powered actuator. Furthermore, a kirigami-inspired approach is also presented that allows creating high force-high stroke actuators that combine the highly stretchable kirigami-inspired meta-materials and SMAs. Here, in this chapter, these actuators are validated using experimental results and a proof-of-concept SMA linear actuator.

\subsection*{\textsc{Chapter 6}: Validation using a Novel SMA Gripper System}
Finally, in this last chapter, the various design principles, methodology and sizing strategies are exploited to create a bistable SMA gripper. This case study is used to validate the design methodology and sizing strategy proposed in the previous chapters by implementing them in the design of the gripper. Here, the gripper is powered using a pair of antagonistic SMA helical coils and makes use of flexure-based buckled beams and pivots to create a compact and light weight bistable industrial gripper. In this chapter, an analytical model of the flexural gripper is described and present so as to enable the sizing of the SMA elements. In this chapter, the sizing methodology, presented in the previous chapters, enables using the thinnest SMA spring that still enables the snap-through of the buckled beam allowing the gripper to have a short cooling period thereby, increasing the bandwidth of the industrial gripper. This chapter, along with the various case studies present in this work, give a concrete application in which the proposed design methodologies can be implemented.

\subsection*{Conclusion and Contributions}
