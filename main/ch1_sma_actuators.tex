\chapter{Overview of SMA Actuator Design}\label{chap:sma-actuator-design}
\section{Introduction}
In the scope of miniaturisation, creating highly integrated robotic system has become possible with the help of smart materials, notably Shape Memory Alloys (SMA). These alloys, having the highest work density, has made it possible to create miniature artificial muscles that can be integrated into compact and lightweight applications. SMAs have an interesting behaviour which consists of recovery any strain imposed on it when heated above a certain critical temperature threshold, often referred to as the Shape Memory Effect (SME). These alloys exploit the SME to create reversible actuators that are lightweight and compact. This effect is highly non-linear and is dependant on multiple variables, resulting in a highly complex and difficult to model behaviour. Thus, designing and sizing these alloys to create optimised actuators for complex applications is difficult and cumbersome.

In this chapter, an overview of the different implementations of SMA actuators are explored. In the context of different applications, the SMA actuators that are embedded in the different robotic systems are investigated. The traditional design methodology for these actuators are studied and presented in this chapter. The different examples of SMA actuators are used to create a conventional design methodology and the different subsystems of the robotic systems are studied. In this chapter, an in-depth look into the advantages and limitation of the methodology is conducted. In this manner, the conventional design methodology can be adapted into taking a holistic view of the robotic system and create a novel design approach that further promotes the integration of the SMA actuator subsystems into the final robotic system.

\section{Working Principle of SMA Actuators}
Shape Memory Alloys are subclass of smart materials that react to heat. This special brand of material where the can mechanically react with the help of some micro-structural changes when subjected to an external non-mechanical stimulus, in this case, temperature. The shape memory effect that occurs in this alloys occurs due to some phase transformation that happens when heated and cooled around a certain transition temperature. At low temperatures, the material exists in its Martensite (M) phase where the material can be deformed easily. These deformations, similar to plastic deformation, results in the material being permanently deformed at these low temperatures. As the alloy is heated up its transition temperature, the material transforms from the M phase to the Austenite (A) phase, recovering any of the \textit{"permanent"} strain imposed on it at low temperatures. This capacity to recover any strain imposed on it and return back to its original shape is often referred to as the shape memory effect. As the material cools below the transition temperature, the alloy returns back to the M phase, allowing the material to be \textit{"plastically"} deformed once again. The detailed description, along with the analytical and numerical models, is detailed in \cref{chap:sma-model}.

The basic idea behind the implementation of the actuator powered by SMAs is to pair the active material with a biasing element. As stated previously, the SMA element requires a deformation at low temperatures to produce any work when heated to its transition temperature. This implies that for the actuator to behave reversibly and create work cycle, a system is required to deform the SMA at low temperature so as to enable the SMA to produce the actuation when heated. A one-directional SMA actuator is also possible where the SMA is stretched and then heated to revert back to its original shape or constrained to generate an increasing stress based on the applied temperature. These actuators can be used for single actuation application such as deployment mechanisms as shown in the work by \todocite (Mohd Jani 2017 Designing SMA linear actuators). However, in this work, the two-directional SMA actuators are explored and studied. These two-directional actuators require a biasing force as the SMA elements can only in one direction. These linear actuators, thus, require some kind of biasing mechanism that can apply a biasing force in the opposite direction. As shown in the work by \todocite (bellouard), the most common mechanisms used to return the SMA back to its neutral position are bias-springs, dead-weights or another SMA element in an antagonistic configuration as shown in \cref{fig:sma-actuators-diagram}.

\end{figure}
The \textbf{Biased-Deadweight SMA Actuator} has the advantage of being quite simple to implement as it consists of simply applying a constant load to the active element irrespective of the temperature. Here, the SMA based on the phase will displace the constant load by a fixed stroke. At low temperatures, the deadweight elongates the SMA element and as the SMA heats up and changes phase, the load will be displaced. As there is always the same constant load, there is a high risk of overheating the SMA and risking reaching stresses above the recommended maximum pull force of the SMA. Thus, to prevent this irreversible damage to the SMA actuator, a constant load that is below the maximum pull force of the SMA is used. This greatly limits the maximum load that can be displaced by the SMA actuator preventing widespread adoption of this method of implementation.

The \textbf{Biased-Spring SMA Actuator}, on the other hand, consists of pairing the SMA element with a biasing passive spring. This method of implementation is also quite simple to implement and thus, is the most widely used method for designing SMA actuators. Here, the idea consists of using a passive spring to apply a spring force to the SMA at low temperatures. This allows the SMA to be deformed and activates the SME when the alloy is heated. As the material transforms from the M to the A phase, the spring is deformed while the SMA element returns to its original shape. Here, due to the increasing elongation of the spring, an increasing spring force acts on the SMA as the temperature is increased. This implies that based on the temperature and the rigidity of the spring, the force and stroke of the actuator can be sized. The sizing methodology and analytical models of this type of actuator will be detailed in \cref{chap:sma-model}. However, the actuator can only be controlled in one direction during the heating phase, while during the cooling, the SMA actuator returns back to its neutral position uncontrolled.


The \textbf{Antagonistic SMA Actuator} consists of pairing the SMA element with an antagonistic biasing SMA element. In this method, the actuator can be actuated in both directions. As the first SMA is heated, the strain recovery cause the antagonistic SMA to be deformed and elongated. When heating the antagonistic SMA, the inverse effect occurs, where the first SMA is deformed and elongated while the antagonistic SMA reverts back to its original shape. Thus, by alternatively heating the SMA pair, the actuator can be made to actuate in both directions. The primary downside to such an implementation is the difficulty in sizing and controlling such an actuator due to the compounding of the highly non-linear nature of each of the SMAs. These SMAs are still widely used in many applications do to the additional degree of freedom. The sizing methodology of these actuators will be described in \cref{chap:sma-model}.

The three methods of implementation represent the majority of the different types of SMA actuators. Using this biasing principle for pre-stretching the SMA element, a reversible and cyclical actuator can be fabricated. It is important to note that the biasing element along with the SMA represent only the subsystems that create the reversible work offered by the active material. However, when creating an SMA actuator, additional structure and elements are required to form a complete actuator for the required application.

\section{Analysis of SMA Actuators}
As stated previously, the principal advantage of actuators powered by SMAs are the fact that, owing to their high work density, these actuators can be designed to be compact and lightweight. However, this is only the case when designed specifically for the required application. Due to the active nature of the material, when the SME is exploited specifically for the requirements of the use case, the resulting actuator can be integrated into the overall robotic application. Thus, when analysing the various methods in which these SMA actuators are designed, it is important to consider the application and its domain. Due to the long cycling time of the SMA elements, SMA actuators are primarily used in systems and domains where low bandwidth but compact actuators are required. Based on the work by \todocite (Mohd Jani, 2014) and \todocite (sreekumar, 2007), these actuators have been used in automotive as miniaturised actuators for various subsystems to replace traditional electromagnetic or pneumatic actuators. In aerospace applications, where there are geometric volume constraints, they have been used to create micro-grippers, vibration dampers or deployment mechanisms. Furthermore, due to their bio-compatibility, these SMA actuators have also found its way into the biomedical field where they have been used to create miniature medical and surgical instruments such as endoscopes, medical tweezers and stents among others. Recently, however, there has been wide interest in creating miniature bio-inspired and reconfigurable robots where these SMAs are used as artificial muscles. Thus, in this section, the goal is to explore the various domains in which SMA actuators are employed and study, using some examples, the different design parameters and choices used to create appropriate actuators for the appropriate application. By doing so, the important and key factors that make up the design of SMA actuators can be established. These factors can, thus, be used to detail the various ares in which these actuators can be improved and optimised such that when designing future SMA actuators, the final systems can be further integrated. By exploring the design choice used in the following examples, a design methodology can be established for creating novel improved SMA actuators.

% Biomedical
\subsection{Biomedical Applications}
Due to the tight volume constraints in the biomedical field, actuators that prioritize compact footprints have been favoured. Furthermore, in the medical field, reduced noise, vibration, and contamination are necessary. A high time response is not required and slower actuation can be tolerated. This makes it an ideal domain for SMA actuators to flourish. The choice of the examples presented in this section is to examine various types of SMA actuators implemented in the biomedical field to extrapolate the various design parameters and choices used for this specific application.

In the first example, the authors, \todocite, have a developed a mesoscale actuator used to maintain the visual clarity of the lens in endoscopes during invasive robotic surgeries as shown in \cref{fig:biomed-examples}(a). Here the main design criteria were the limitation of contaminants and the extreme volume constraints. The actuator must fit on the end of the tip of the endoscope which is inserted within the body during surgery. The tight footprint required for the project specifications has created a need for smart materials, specifically shape memory alloys, to be used in this application. The alloy being biocompatible has also played a key role in the choice of smart material. The actuator, proposed in this work, consists of a simple bias-spring SMA actuator where the active element consists of a thin SMA wire and the biasing element consists of a passive tractional spring. Here, the actuator, using a pin as a simple pivot, transforms the linear motion of the SMA actuator into a rotation of the lens cover. This cover, considered the output, is used to clear the surgical camera maintain the visual clarity during the surgery.

    \label{fig:biomed-examples}
\end{figure}

In the work by \todocite, the authors have designed and fabricated a multi-segmented SMA-based actuator system for endoscopic applications as shown in \cref{fig:biomed-examples}(b). In this second example, the main design criteria were the volume constraints of the actuator, the biocompatibility of the actuator and the high strokes required. As with the previous example, the actuator is used in minimally invasive surgery and thus requires the actuator to be biocompatible and prevent any unwanted pollution of the body during operation. Further, due to the tight volume constraints of the human body, the actuator makes use of the high volumetric work density of the alloy to create this compact actuator. The actuator proposed in this work consists of multiple bias-spring SMA actuators arranged in an antagonistic manner. Here, a flat SMA spring is used to provide the high strokes required and is paired with an elastic backbone that provides the rigidity for the endoscope while also allowing the SMA spring to return back to its original state during cooling. Opposing SMA flat spring are placed surrounding the biasing element to allow the endoscope to actuate in other directions and increase the degrees of freedom.

In this last example, the authors have designed and fabricated a minimally invasive surgical gripper based on an SMA spring actuator. As stated by the authors, in minimally invasive surgeries, manipulations are often performed in confined and tight spaces and thus, the main design criteria were the miniaturisation of the actuator and maintaining the high energy density of the alloy. In this example, the proposed gripper is fabricated using several components including an SMA spring as the active element and torsional spring as a biasing element as shown in \cref{fig:biomed-examples}(c). Furthermore, a pivot linking system is used as a kinematic stage that converts the linear actuation of the SMA spring into a rotational output of the gripper jaws.

In the case of actuators designed for biomedical applications, there is a large focus for compact and work dense actuators. Furthermore, in some cases, the biocompatibility of the SMA plays a large role in the choice of the actuator. The design of the final actuator in this application is largely dependant on the volume constraints imposed by the human body. Here, actuators generally tend to value stroke over force output and thus, SMA springs are generally used as they come with higher elongations but at the price of lower force outputs. Using bias-spring SMA actuators allows the actuator to have a reversible and cyclical actuation. In the presented examples, the bias-spring was chosen over the antagonistic SMA due to the reduced complexity and simplicity in the control. The implementation of sensors and control electronics can often result in increase volume requirements and can degrade the work density of the final system.

% Automotive / Aerospace
\subsection{Automotive and Aerospace Applications}
As in the case of SMAs in the biomedical field, the high work density and the ability of SMA actuators to be compact and lightweight has allowed them to be attractive in the automotive and aerospace field. A common requirement of automotive products are high miniaturisation and integration. The small size and weight of SMA actuators has made them ideal in aerospace applications. In this section, some examples have been studied to determine the various design requirements of SMA actuators in this field. By studying the various types of automotive or aerospace SMA actuators, the various design criteria and limitations can be extracted.

\end{figure}

In the first example, the authors, \todocite, have designed and fabricated a lightweight and cost effective active mirror actuator as shown in \cref{fig:auto-examples}(a). The traditional power mirrors that use electromechanical actuators have been commonplace in the automotive industry. The authors have designed an alternative using SMAs to create an active automobile power mirror that is lightweight and work dense actuator. In this work, the active mirror consists of a biasing spring surrounded by four SMA wires. The mirror, mounted on a spherical joint, can be actuated in the four cardinal directions. Since a limited stroke length is required, SMA wires have been used to actuate the mirror. Furthermore, a single passive spring has been implemented as a biasing element for each of the SMA wire actuators. The spherical pivot on which the mirror is mounted converts the linear movement of the SMA actuator into the required rotational movement. The SMA wires are actuated using Joule's heating by passing a current across the wires. The control of the actuator is performed by using a variable structure controller. The authors have focused their work to be lightweight and robust and thus have used the high work density of the alloy to their advantage.

In the second example, the authors, \todocite, have sized and fabricated a binary SMA actuator for automotive tumble flaps. Here, this solid-state actuation system is developed to replace the existing traditional electromagnetic and pneumatic actuators used in the industry. In this work, the authors focused on creating a miniature actuator by harnessing the high work density of the shape memory alloy. The main constraints presented in this work, as stated by the author, are the power to weight ratio, robustness and reliability of the actuators. Furthermore, the clean, silent and smooth operation of the actuator in addition to its self-sensing capabilities added to the attractive nature of the material in this application. In this prototype, the basic concept consists of using SMA coils with an antagonistic SMA coil as the biasing element as shown in \cref{fig:auto-examples}(b). Furthermore, in the work, a thermoelectric module is used to aid in the heat transfer from one SMA coil to the other for increased operation frequency. Here, a pair of SMA coils are used in parallel to increase the overall force output of the actuator.

In this final example, the authors, \todocite, have integrated an SMA actuator within the wing of aircraft to create an active span-wise adaptive wing as shown in \cref{fig:auto-examples}(c). In the aerospace domain, creating lightweight actuators that can reduce the load for aircrafts is the primary constraint that have allowed SMAs to penetrate the industry. The high work density of the materials allows for the creation of lightweight actuators that can still produce the large forces required in this application as displayed in this work. SMA actuators can be utilized to build safer, lighter, and less complicated systems that are compatible with future electric-aircraft concepts. In this work, a bias-spring rotational SMA actuator is created to alter the shape of the wing. A SMA tube is paired with a torsional bias spring to create the rotation actuator. Position sensors and a heating cartridge is integrated into the system to create the full working prototype for the adaptive wing. Due to the low profile of the structure and by using an SMA tube, the entire actuator fits withing the profile of the wing while still delivering high output forces.

As shown in these examples, the high force output and the ability to create lightweight systems has been the primary design criteria that has allowed SMA actuator to proliferate in this engineering domain. In each example, the high work density of the SMA has been exploited to create actuators that can produce large force while remaining compact and lightweight. In each example, discrete systems were used to create the active and biasing elements. A separate conversion mechanism employing hinges or pivots were used in each case to convert the output of the SMA actuator into the required motions showing an area in which some degrading of the work density is present.
