	abstract = {This article presents a soft crawling robot prototype with a simple architecture inspired by inchworms. The robot functionally integrates the torso (body) and feet in a monolithic curved structure that only needs a single shape memory alloy coil and differential friction to actuate it. A novel foot configuration is proposed, which makes the two feet, with an anti-symmetrical friction layout, can be alternately anchored, to match the contraction–recovery sequence of the body adaptively. Based on the antagonistic configuration between the shape memory alloy actuator and the elastic body, a vertically auxiliary spring was adopted to enhance the interaction mechanism. Force and kinematic analysis was undertaken, focusing on the parametric design of the special foot configuration. A miniature robot prototype was then 3D-printed (54 mm in length and 9.77 g in weight), using tailored thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer as the body material. A series of experimental tests and evaluations were carried out to assess its performance under different conditions. The results demonstrated that under appropriate actuation conditions, the compact robot prototype could accomplish a relative speed of 0.024 BL/s (with a stride length equivalent to 27\% of its body length) and bear a load over five times to its own weight.},

	abstract = {Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are popular as actuators for soft bioinspired robots because they are naturally compliant, have high work density, and can be operated using miniaturized on-board electronics for power and control. However, SMA actuators typically exhibit limited bandwidth due to the long duration of time required for the alloy to cool down and return to its natural shape and compliance following electrical actuation. This challenge is addressed by constructing SMA-based actuators out of thermally conductive elastomers and examining the influence of electrical current and actuation frequency on blocking force, bending amplitude, and operating temperature. The actuator is composed of a U-shape SMA wire that is sandwiched between layers of stretched and unstretched thermal elastomer. Based on the studies, the ability is demonstrated to create a highly dynamic soft actuator that weighs 3.7 g, generates a force of ≈0.2 N, bends with curvature change of ≈60 m−1 in 0.15 s, and can be activated with a frequency above 0.3 Hz with a pair of miniature 3.7 V lithium–polymer batteries. Together, these properties allow the actuator to be used as an “artificial muscle” for a variety of tethered and untethered soft robotic systems capable of fast dynamic locomotion.},
