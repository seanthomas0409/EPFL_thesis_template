	abstract = {A three-ﬁngered gripper with ﬂexure hinges actuated by shape memory alloy (SMA) wires was designed and prototyped. The aim of the work was the manipulation of small, almost cylindrical objects, e.g. test tubes, by a device having small overall dimensions. A parametric study of four different, but similar, ﬁngers was conducted with the aim of obtaining a solution with a good ampliﬁcation ratio and a gripping force almost constant during closure. The use of ﬂexure hinges simpliﬁes the design, but limits the ﬁnger range of motion. Moreover, it was possible to ﬁnd a conﬁguration with sufﬁcient work space. Once the ﬁnger geometry was deﬁned, the whole hand was then designed with the aim of producing a compact hand contained in a cylindrical volume (φ 65×h 65 mm), and the ﬁrst prototype was built. Preliminary tests demonstrated its good dimensioning and the success of some technological solutions. The experimental transmission ratio was almost the same as the theoretical one. Some drawbacks have been highlighted, such as a reduced range of motion and incomplete backstroke; future studies will deal with them.},
