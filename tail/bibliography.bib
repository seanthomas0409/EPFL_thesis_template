	abstract = {A three-ﬁngered gripper with ﬂexure hinges actuated by shape memory alloy (SMA) wires was designed and prototyped. The aim of the work was the manipulation of small, almost cylindrical objects, e.g. test tubes, by a device having small overall dimensions. A parametric study of four different, but similar, ﬁngers was conducted with the aim of obtaining a solution with a good ampliﬁcation ratio and a gripping force almost constant during closure. The use of ﬂexure hinges simpliﬁes the design, but limits the ﬁnger range of motion. Moreover, it was possible to ﬁnd a conﬁguration with sufﬁcient work space. Once the ﬁnger geometry was deﬁned, the whole hand was then designed with the aim of producing a compact hand contained in a cylindrical volume (φ 65×h 65 mm), and the ﬁrst prototype was built. Preliminary tests demonstrated its good dimensioning and the success of some technological solutions. The experimental transmission ratio was almost the same as the theoretical one. Some drawbacks have been highlighted, such as a reduced range of motion and incomplete backstroke; future studies will deal with them.},

	abstract = {Binary systems can lead to simple and efficient robotic and mechatronic systems since such systems use a large number of simple bistable actuators to affect its state. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are prime candidates for use in binary systems since they are simple, low cost, and lightweight. However, previously proposed bistable DEAs (flip-flop) have relatively low volumetric energy density that limits their use in practical devices. This paper investigates the potential of improving the energy density of bistable designs by employing DEAs in compact antagonistic configurations. To do so, two antagonistic configurations (linear and rotating) are designed and studied using an experimentally validated Bergstrom–Boyce viscoelastic material model. The proposed antagonistic configurations show up to ∼10× higher volumetric energy densities than flip-flop designs. This represents a significant advantage for DEA reliability, since, based on volumetric energy density, antagonist actuators require the manufacturing of significantly less film layers than flip-flop designs. This study also reveals that, in the design of antagonistic DEAs, limiting the polymer film's actuation stretch minimizes viscoelastic losses and allows higher actuation speeds and power outputs for a given actuator stroke and size.},

	doi = {10.1109/TMECH.2020.3037303},
	abstract = {Micro aerial vehicles (MAV) with multiple rotors, or multicopters, have many promising applications ranging from environmental monitoring, agricultural inspection, to package delivery. These applications, however, usually face a critical problem: the flight time of MAVs is limited due to the low aerodynamic efficiency and high energy consumption. One promising solution is to make them rest on desired objects using perching, an important capability in biological flyers (e.g., birds). In this paper, we present the design and experimentation of a novel perching mechanism: a low cost, 3D printed gripper with bistability (i.e., two stable states). The gripper has two unique characteristics. First, using bistability, it can passively switch from open to closed state using the impact between the gripper and the perching object, alleviating the requirement for precise motion control. Second, the gripper has two perching methods for different objects. For objects with a small height, it can form a closed diamond shape to encircle the objects (encircling method). For objects with a large height, the gripper's two fingers can clip on each side of the objects to utilize the friction forces for perching (clipping method). We analyze the proposed gripper design to predict the required force for opening and closing the gripper. We also predict the size of objects that will allow for successful perching for the clipping method. All the theoretical analyses are experimentally verified. Finally, we integrate the gripper onto a palm-size quadcopter to enable a mechatronic system for perching, and demonstrate successful perching with both clipping and encircling methods as well as aerial grasping. Although our bistable gripper is used with a palm-size quadcopter, the design strategy can also be applied to large-size MAVs for both energy efficient perching and aerial grasping.},

This paper presents our designs based on planar serial 2-DOF linear isotropic springs. We propose two architectures, both based on parallel leaf springs, then evaluate their isotropy defect using firstly an analytic model, secondly finite element analysis and thirdly experimental data measured from physical prototypes. Using these results, we analyze the isotropy defect in terms of displacement, radial distance, angular separation, stiffness and linearity. Based on this analysis, we propose improved architectures stacking in parallel or in series duplicate copies of the original mechanisms rotated at specific angles to cancel isotropy defect. We show that using the mechanisms in pairs reduces isotropy defect by one to two orders of magnitude.},

The state of the art recalls the abundant literature published on the parallel leaf spring stage, and presents the few articles found dealing with the parallel spring stages. The theoretical modeling for the calculation of the linear stiffness of the parallel spring stage is described. The starting point of the discussion is the observation that the theoretical model which is valid when applied to stages of large dimensions produces large errors when applied to wire-EDM machined flexures of very thin cross-sections. As an explanation of this observation, a hypothesis is put forward: on the surface of each neck a thin layer affected by the EDM process is not playing any mechanical role in the bending of the flexure and the thickness of this layer is related to the roughness of the surface. The experimental results show that the hypothesis is true to a large extent but that roughness is probably not the only factor affecting the neutral zone. The 'white layer' and the microstructural homogeneity of the material used could also be determinant.},

Micromechanical properties such as beam deformation, pivot position and pivot shift are investigated and compared with the virtual pivot formed by a cantilever beam. It is shown that the real pivot has negligible shift when subjected to load and fabrication error owing to its feature of structural symmetry, while the virtual pivot suffers from significant pivot shift, which would severely limit the wavelength tuning range. The two pivot designs are implemented into MEMS tuning structures that are fabricated by deep etching and released using a dry release approach. The real pivot measures a depth variation of 16\% over the double-clamped beam but maintains the symmetry to the midpoint, and is still able to produce a rotation angle of 4.7deg. In contrast, the virtual pivot has a depth reduction of 4\% over the cantilever beam, but achieves only a 2.4deg rotation due to the pull-in problem originated from the severe pivot shift. The real pivot design is more suitable for the MEMS tunable lasers as it is simple, symmetric, robust, and suitable for single-chip integration},

	abstract = {Insects are a constant source of inspiration for roboticists. Their compliant bodies allow them to squeeze through small openings and be highly resilient to impacts. However, making subgram autonomous soft robots untethered and capable of responding intelligently to the environment is a long-standing challenge. One obstacle is the low power density of soft actuators, leading to small robots unable to carry their sense and control electronics and a power supply. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), a class of electrostatic electroactive polymers, allow for kilohertz operation with high power density but require typically several kilovolts to reach full strain. The mass of kilovolt supplies has limited DEA robot speed and performance. In this work, we report low-voltage stacked DEAs (LVSDEAs) with an operating voltage below 450 volts and used them to propel an insect-sized (40 millimeters long) soft untethered and autonomous legged robot. The DEAnsect body, with three LVSDEAs to drive its three legs, weighs 190 milligrams and can carry a 950-milligram payload (five times its body weight). The unloaded DEAnsect moves at 30 millimeters/second and is very robust by virtue of its compliance. The sub–500-volt operation voltage enabled us to develop 780-milligram drive electronics, including optical sensors, a microcontroller, and a battery, for two channels to output 450 volts with frequencies up to 1 kilohertz. By integrating this flexible printed circuit board with the DEAnsect, we developed a subgram robot capable of autonomous navigation, independently following printed paths. This work paves the way for new generations of resilient soft and fast untethered robots.},

The robot consists of a deformable body driven by dielectric elastomer actuators, and two paper-based feet driven by electroadhesion actuators. The use of light-weight batteries and small-volume amplifiers contributes to the development of this untethered soft robot. Inspired by inchworms, this untethered soft robot can achieve locomotion through alternate expansion/contraction of its deformable body and adhesion/detachment of its two paper-based feet. The strong electroadhesion ensures a stable locomotion, and the large voltage-induced deformation and fast response of the robotic body leads to a velocity of 0.02 body length/s. This velocity is higher than that of untethered soft crawling robots based on pneumatic actuators or ionic polymer metal composites. The deformation of the robotic body is studied through finite element analysis. Compared to traditional hard robots, soft robots are found to be more susceptible to dissipative processes, including charging/discharging the actuators, dielectric relaxation and viscoelastic effects. These dissipative effects on this untethered soft robot are also investigated in this paper.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes three design concepts for developing a crawling robot inspired by an inchworm, called the Omegabot. First, for locomotion, the robot strides by bending its body into an omega shape; anisotropic friction pads enable the robot to move forward using this simple motion. Second, the robot body is made of a single part but has two four-bar mechanisms and one spherical six-bar mechanism; the mechanisms are 2-D patterned into a single piece of composite and folded to become a robot body that weighs less than 1 g and that can crawl and steer. This design does not require the assembly of various mechanisms of the body structure, thereby simplifying the fabrication process. Third, a new concept for using a shape-memory alloy (SMA) coil-spring actuator is proposed; the coil spring is designed to have a large spring index and to work over a large pitch-angle range. This large-index-and-pitch SMA spring actuator cools faster and requires less energy, without compromising the amount of force and displacement that it can produce. Therefore, the frequency and the efficiency of the actuator are improved. A prototype was used to demonstrate that the inchworm-inspired, novel, small-scale, lightweight robot manufactured on a single piece of composite can crawl and steer.},
