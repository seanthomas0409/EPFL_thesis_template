	abstract = {This article proposes a numerical model to predict actuation frequencies (strain-cycling frequencies) for 1-D shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators. The numerical model is designed by comprehensively considering the factors that significantly affect an SMA actuator's strain-cycling frequency, i.e., heat convection methods, constant or nonconstant bias loads, and Joule heating methods. For computing strain cycles of SMA actuators, we develop a computation framework that effectively integrates an SMA constitutive model, a phase transformation kinetic model, stress-strain models for different types of bias stress, and a heat transfer model of SMA wires. The strain and temperature rates are formulated by nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The strain and temperature cycles can be accurately approximated by numerical iterative methods. Experimental verification was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model. By initially identifying the SMA characteristic parameters, we employed Latin hypercube sampling method to generate 30 sets of design parameters for comparing the predicted and measured actuation frequencies. In addition, we investigated how the uncertainty of premeasured SMA characteristic parameters affect the numerical prediction of actuation frequency by conducting sensitivity analysis. The experiments demonstrate \$0.7\%{\textbackslash}text–9.03\%\$ and \$2.65\%{\textbackslash}text–17.57\%\$ differences between predicted and measured actuation frequencies for constant bias loads and spring bias loads, respectively.},

Compared with other developed constitutive relations, this thermomechanical constitutive relation not only reflects the physical essence of shape memory alloys, i.e., the martensitic phase transformation involved, but also provides an easy-to-use design tool for engineers. It can predict and describe the behavior of SMA quantitatively. A multi-dimensional constitutive relation for shape memory alloys is further developed based on the one-dimensional model. It can be used to study the mechanical behavior including shape memory effect of complex SMA structures that have never been analytically studied, and provide quantitative analysis for many diverse applications of shape memory alloys.  A general design method for shape memory alloy actuators has also been developed based on the developed constitutive relation and transient thermal considerations. The design methodology provides a quantitative approach to determine the design parameters of shape memory alloy force actuators, including both bias spring SMA force actuators and differential SMA force actuators.},

	abstract = {Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are popular as actuators for soft bioinspired robots because they are naturally compliant, have high work density, and can be operated using miniaturized on-board electronics for power and control. However, SMA actuators typically exhibit limited bandwidth due to the long duration of time required for the alloy to cool down and return to its natural shape and compliance following electrical actuation. This challenge is addressed by constructing SMA-based actuators out of thermally conductive elastomers and examining the influence of electrical current and actuation frequency on blocking force, bending amplitude, and operating temperature. The actuator is composed of a U-shape SMA wire that is sandwiched between layers of stretched and unstretched thermal elastomer. Based on the studies, the ability is demonstrated to create a highly dynamic soft actuator that weighs 3.7 g, generates a force of ≈0.2 N, bends with curvature change of ≈60 m−1 in 0.15 s, and can be activated with a frequency above 0.3 Hz with a pair of miniature 3.7 V lithium–polymer batteries. Together, these properties allow the actuator to be used as an “artificial muscle” for a variety of tethered and untethered soft robotic systems capable of fast dynamic locomotion.},

To overcome these problems, a novel design of parallel gripper actuated by a large-stroke shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator is proposed in this paper. The mechanical design of the gripper is presented and each component is expounded in details. Multiple SMA wires are connected in series to achieve a larger stroke of the actuator. A light-weight, small-volume cross-shear hinge coupler is designed to ensure the symmetry and synchronism of the movement of the two gripping arms. In order to evaluate the working performance of the proposed SMA gripper, three theoretical models are developed for bias element selection, gripping force calculation and capture range analysis. A prototype of the gripper is fabricated and a series of experiments are conducted. The actuation characteristics under different bias forces and different currents are tested. The relationship between the gripping force and the sizes of targets are compared. The experimental observations are in good agreement with the theoretical results which demonstrates the correctness of the proposed models. Research results indicate that the proposed SMA gripper can grasp targets reliably and adaptively.},

The focus of this paper is on the development of a second generation prototype of an SMA-actuated vacuum gripper that does not require continuous activation during gripping. For evaluation and validation of the gripper system, a test rig is used to measure the created vacuum with a pressure sensor and the deflected membrane with a laser displacement sensor during operation. Different experiments take a look at the vacuum quality over time, lifting forces and repeatability. The paper ends with an outlook on future work and a discussion of possible application scenarios.},

A shape memory alloy-based curved bending actuator manufactured by double casting is introduced in this work. Curved actuators are capable of larger maximum bending angles with the same cross-section configuration as a straight actuator, and both the design method and the casting method proposed in this work are novel for this type of actuator. The effect of the initial bending angle due to the curvature of the actuator and of non-uniform initial curvatures on the maximum bending angle was tested. A model based on the thermoconstitutive model of SMA with a geometrical analysis of the deformation of the actuator was used to estimate the effect of the initial curvature on the maximum bending angle of the actuator. Finally, multiple curved actuators were implemented as a simple gripper and the lifting force of straight and curved actuators were compared, and the curved gripper has a lifting force nearly three times larger than the straight gripper. This type of concept can be used to tailor the force, deformed shape and maximum deformation of SMA actuators.},

This paper presents the design, the prototype fabrication, and the functional testing of a case study, where an SMA binary actuator is used for automotive tumble flaps. The innovative solid-state actuation system is proposed as an alternative to electromagnetic and pneumatic effectors, traditionally used to drive the tumble shaft of an air intake manifold for internal combustion engines. Original features of the linear actuator involve the mechanical architecture and the control structure. On the mechanical side, two contrasting sets of SMA springs are used to actively generate the net actuating force during both out-stroke and in-stroke. On the control side, a current feedback is exploited for sensorless real-time monitoring of the working temperature of the SMA springs during electrical supply. Major shortcomings of the proposed solution are a low response time and a power consumption higher than pneumatic and electromagnetic counterparts.},

The applications presented here have acknowledged these shortcomings and are built on previous successes to thrust SMAs a step closer to aircraft adoption. The spanwise adaptive wing (SAW) project and the wind tunnel remote control actuation (RCA) are the new applications that employ new advancement. First, the SAW project is the first ever, fully integrated flight test employing high-temperature SMAs with flight-relevant properties. The project utilized NiTiHf alloys with suitable actuation temperatures, and scalable to commercially available lots/forms. Second, the RCA project represents the next paradigm shift in wind tunnel testing. This application employs NiTi torque tubes capable of moving and controlling the model parts, enabling increased productivity, improved data quality, and reduced cost of wind tunnel testing.

	abstract = {An ultrastretchable film device is developed that can follow the shape of spherical and large deformable biological samples such as heart and brain tissues. Although the film is composed of biocompatible parylene for the device substrate and metal layers of platinum (Pt)/titanium (Ti), which are unstretchable materials, the film shows a high stretchability by patterning slits as a “Kirigami” design. A Pt/Ti-microelectrode array embedded in 11 µm thick parylene film with 5 × 91 slits exhibits a film strain of ≈250\% at 9 mN strain-force (0.08 MPa in stress) with a Young's modulus of 23 kPa, while the 3 × 91-slit film shows a Young's modulus of 3.6 kPa. The maximum strains of these devices are ≈470\% and ≈840\%, respectively. It is demonstrated that the Kirigami-based microelectrode device can simultaneously record in vivo electrocorticogram signals from the visual and barrel cortices of a mouse by stretching the film and tuning the electrode gap. Moreover, wrapping the Kirigami device around a beating mouse's heart, which shows large and rapid changes in the volume and the surface area, can record the in vivo epicardial electrocardiogram signals. Such a small Young's modulus for a stretchable device reduces the device's strain-force, minimizing the device-induced stress to soft biological tissues.},

	abstract = {Flying insects capable of navigating in highly cluttered natural environments can withstand in-flight collisions because of the combination of their low inertia1 and the resilience of their wings2, exoskeletons1 and muscles. Current insect-scale (less than ten centimetres long and weighing less than five grams) aerial robots3–6 use rigid microscale actuators, which are typically fragile under external impact. Biomimetic artificial muscles7–10 that are capable of large deformation offer a promising alternative for actuation because they can endure the stresses caused by such impacts. However, existing soft actuators11–13 have not yet demonstrated sufficient power density to achieve lift-off, and their actuation nonlinearity and limited bandwidth create further challenges for achieving closed-loop (driven by an input control signal that is adjusted based on sensory feedback) flight control. Here we develop heavier-than-air aerial robots powered by soft artificial muscles that demonstrate open-loop (driven by a predetermined signal without feedback), passively stable (upright during flight) ascending flight as well as closed-loop, hovering flight. The robots are driven by multi-layered dielectric elastomer actuators that weigh 100 milligrams each and have a resonance frequency of 500 hertz and power density of 600 watts per kilogram. To increase the mechanical power output of the actuator and to demonstrate flight control, we present ways to overcome challenges unique to soft actuators, such as nonlinear transduction and dynamic buckling. These robots can sense and withstand collisions with surrounding obstacles and can recover from in-flight collisions by exploiting material robustness and vehicle passive stability. We also fly two micro-aerial vehicles simultaneously in a cluttered environment. They collide with the wall and each other without suffering damage. These robots rely on offboard amplifiers and an external motion-capture system to provide power to the dielectric elastomer actuators and to control their flight. Our work demonstrates how soft actuators can achieve sufficient power density and bandwidth to enable controlled flight, illustrating the potential of developing next-generation agile soft robots.},

Introduction of compliance as a form of morphological computation was also considered to enhance grasping capabilities, where multi-material 3D printing would facilitate rapid design changes based on target application. To grasp different objects, the gripper has hot-swappable 3D printed fingertips which are optimized with a multi-objective Bayesian Optimization process using physical bench experiments mimicking drone grasping and ascent on a common object set. The morphology of the fingertip including tip width, curvature and distribution of soft and hard material on contact surface, are optimized with a bench test that mimics quadcopter takeoff and landing. The best design from optimization shows an improvement of more than 10\% from the initial design in successful grasp operations, demonstrated by field tests with a quadcopter.},

The soft robotic gripper was made of shape memory alloys (SMAs) with contraction and variable stiffness properties. A variable stiffness mechanism with embedded sets of SMA fibers was developed; however, the response characteristics of its backbone did not comply with the constant-curvature model when it was subjected to complex forces/torques, such as gravity, grasping forces and driving torques. In this case, the Cosserat theory was used to implement real-time computations of the grasping force of the soft robotic gripper that was subjected to complex forces. Finally, a series of tests were conducted on the grasping force of the soft finger and the gripper. The elicited results showed that the grasping force is related to the stiffness and to the object's offset and friction coefficient. Moreover, experimental results showed that the grasping force of the soft robotic gripper increased by 48.7\% when the Young's modulus of the SMA-2 wires increased from 25 GPa to 48 GPa.},

Here, we present an origamiinspired reconﬁgurable suction gripper to address adaptability with robotic suction grippers. Constructed from rigid and soft components and driven by compact shape memory alloy actuators, the gripper can effectively self-fold into three shape modes to pick large and small ﬂat, narrow cylindrical, triangular and spherical objects. The 10-g few centimeters gripper, lifts loads up to 5 N, 50 times its weight. We also present an underactuated prototype, demonstrating the versatility of our design and actuation methods.},

Yet owing to the stochastic emergence and distribution of strain-concentrating defects and to the stiffening of nanoscale components at high strains, such composites often possess unpredictable strain–property relationships. Here, by taking inspiration from kirigami—the Japanese art of paper cutting—we show that a network of notches6,7,8 made in rigid nanocomposite and other composite sheets by top-down patterning techniques prevents unpredictable local failure and increases the ultimate strain of the sheets from 4 to 370\%. We also show that the sheets’ tensile behaviour can be accurately predicted through finite-element modelling. Moreover, in marked contrast to other stretchable conductors3,4,5, the electrical conductance of the stretchable kirigami sheets is maintained over the entire strain regime, and we demonstrate their use to tune plasma-discharge phenomena. The unique properties of kirigami nanocomposites as plasma electrodes open up a wide range of novel technological solutions for stretchable electronics and optoelectronic devices, among other application possibilities.},

The resistivity of the SMA thin film is suitable for Joule heating, which allows direct electrical control of the actuator.

While there is a considerable body of research documented on the cyclic fatigue of Nitinol in uniaxial tension or bending, there remains an almost total lack of comprehensive fatigue lifetime data for other loading conditions, such as torsion and tension/torsion. In this work, thin-walled Nitinol tubes were cycled in torsion at various mean and alternating strains to investigate the fatigue life behavior of Nitinol and results compared to equivalent fatigue data collected under uniaxial tensile/bending loads. Using these strain-life results for various loading modes and an equivalent referential (Lagrangian) strain approach, a strategy for normalizing these data is presented. Based on this strategy, a fatigue lifetime prediction model for the multiaxial loading of Nitinol is presented utilizing a modified Coffin–Manson approach where the number of cycles to failure is related to the equivalent alternating transformation strain.},

A parametric study of four different, but similar, ﬁngers was conducted with the aim of obtaining a solution with a good ampliﬁcation ratio and a gripping force almost constant during closure. The use of ﬂexure hinges simpliﬁes the design, but limits the ﬁnger range of motion. Moreover, it was possible to ﬁnd a conﬁguration with sufﬁcient work space.

Preliminary tests demonstrated its good dimensioning and the success of some technological solutions. The experimental transmission ratio was almost the same as the theoretical one.

Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are prime candidates for use in binary systems since they are simple, low cost, and lightweight. However, previously proposed bistable DEAs (flip-flop) have relatively low volumetric energy density that limits their use in practical devices. This paper investigates the potential of improving the energy density of bistable designs by employing DEAs in compact antagonistic configurations. To do so, two antagonistic configurations (linear and rotating) are designed and studied using an experimentally validated Bergstrom–Boyce viscoelastic material model. The proposed antagonistic configurations show up to ∼10× higher volumetric energy densities than flip-flop designs. This represents a significant advantage for DEA reliability, since, based on volumetric energy density, antagonist actuators require the manufacturing of significantly less film layers than flip-flop designs. This study also reveals that, in the design of antagonistic DEAs, limiting the polymer film's actuation stretch minimizes viscoelastic losses and allows higher actuation speeds and power outputs for a given actuator stroke and size.},

	abstract = {Micro aerial vehicles (MAV) with multiple rotors, or multicopters, have many promising applications ranging from environmental monitoring, agricultural inspection, to package delivery. These applications, however, usually face a critical problem: the flight time of MAVs is limited due to the low aerodynamic efficiency and high energy consumption. One promising solution is to make them rest on desired objects using perching, an important capability in biological flyers (e.g., birds). In this paper, we present the design and experimentation of a novel perching mechanism: a low cost, 3D printed gripper with bistability (i.e., two stable states). The gripper has two unique characteristics. First, using bistability, it can passively switch from open to closed state using the impact between the gripper and the perching object, alleviating the requirement for precise motion control. Second, the gripper has two perching methods for different objects. For objects with a small height, it can form a closed diamond shape to encircle the objects (encircling method). For objects with a large height, the gripper's two fingers can clip on each side of the objects to utilize the friction forces for perching (clipping method). We analyze the proposed gripper design to predict the required force for opening and closing the gripper. We also predict the size of objects that will allow for successful perching for the clipping method. All the theoretical analyses are experimentally verified. Finally, we integrate the gripper onto a palm-size quadcopter to enable a mechatronic system for perching, and demonstrate successful perching with both clipping and encircling methods as well as aerial grasping. Although our bistable gripper is used with a palm-size quadcopter, the design strategy can also be applied to large-size MAVs for both energy efficient perching and aerial grasping.},

Using these results, we analyze the isotropy defect in terms of displacement, radial distance, angular separation, stiffness and linearity. Based on this analysis, we propose improved architectures stacking in parallel or in series duplicate copies of the original mechanisms rotated at specific angles to cancel isotropy defect.

The state of the art recalls the abundant literature published on the parallel leaf spring stage, and presents the few articles found dealing with the parallel spring stages. The theoretical modeling for the calculation of the linear stiffness of the parallel spring stage is described. The starting point of the discussion is the observation that the theoretical model which is valid when applied to stages of large dimensions produces large errors when applied to wire-EDM machined flexures of very thin cross-sections. As an explanation of this observation, a hypothesis is put forward: on the surface of each neck a thin layer affected by the EDM process is not playing any mechanical role in the bending of the flexure and the thickness of this layer is related to the roughness of the surface. The experimental results show that the hypothesis is true to a large extent but that roughness is probably not the only factor affecting the neutral zone. The 'white layer' and the microstructural homogeneity of the material used could also be determinant.},

It is shown that the real pivot has negligible shift when subjected to load and fabrication error owing to its feature of structural symmetry, while the virtual pivot suffers from significant pivot shift, which would severely limit the wavelength tuning range. The two pivot designs are implemented into MEMS tuning structures that are fabricated by deep etching and released using a dry release approach. The real pivot measures a depth variation of 16\% over the double-clamped beam but maintains the symmetry to the midpoint, and is still able to produce a rotation angle of 4.7deg. In contrast, the virtual pivot has a depth reduction of 4\% over the cantilever beam, but achieves only a 2.4deg rotation due to the pull-in problem originated from the severe pivot shift.

A mechanical logic switch is designed to determine the activation timing for a pair of antagonistic shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators. Meanwhile, a compliant pre-strain bistable mechanism is introduced to cooperate with the SMA actuators achieving reliable reciprocating motion between the two stable positions. The SMA actuator is modeled base on a static two-state theory while the bistable mechanism is described by combining a pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM) with a Bi-beam constraint model (Bi-BCM). Following this, the design parameters of the bistable mechanism and SMA actuators are determined according to theoretical simulations. Finally, a robotic prototype is fabricated using anisotropic friction on its feet to convert the reciprocating motion of the actuator to uni-directional locomotion of the robot body over a surface. Experiments are carried out to validate the presented design concept and the modeling methods.},

There have been many kinds of mobile micro robot using the micro actuators such as ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC), micro motors and piezo actuators. These actuators generally require electric cable for power supply, which might highly influence the mobility of the micro robot. Therefore, a perfect wireless micro robot comprising telemetry and batteries is realized using only one SMA spring actuator and one silicone bellow. The SMA actuator and bellow play a role in contraction and extension of an earthworm muscle respectively. Based on theoretical analysis, specifications of a SMA actuator and a bellow are properly selected. For temporal stopping, setae of earthworm mimicked claws are employed. On the issue of control, the proposed robot is controlled according to On/Off signal via wireless communication. The operation is customized through tuning of on-/off-time of an actuator and using different type batteries such as a lithium, silver oxide and alkaline battery. After the design and experiment, we find out that the earthworm-like micro robot without wired power supply and control can move freely without limitation of working space and be fabricated easily.},

The robot functionally integrates the torso (body) and feet in a monolithic curved structure that only needs a single shape memory alloy coil and differential friction to actuate it. A novel foot configuration is proposed, which makes the two feet, with an anti-symmetrical friction layout, can be alternately anchored, to match the contraction–recovery sequence of the body adaptively. Based on the antagonistic configuration between the shape memory alloy actuator and the elastic body, a vertically auxiliary spring was adopted to enhance the interaction mechanism. Force and kinematic analysis was undertaken, focusing on the parametric design of the special foot configuration. A miniature robot prototype was then 3D-printed (54 mm in length and 9.77 g in weight), using tailored thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer as the body material. A series of experimental tests and evaluations were carried out to assess its performance under different conditions. The results demonstrated that under appropriate actuation conditions, the compact robot prototype could accomplish a relative speed of 0.024 BL/s (with a stride length equivalent to 27\% of its body length) and bear a load over five times to its own weight.},

	abstract = {Insects are a constant source of inspiration for roboticists. Their compliant bodies allow them to squeeze through small openings and be highly resilient to impacts. However, making subgram autonomous soft robots untethered and capable of responding intelligently to the environment is a long-standing challenge. One obstacle is the low power density of soft actuators, leading to small robots unable to carry their sense and control electronics and a power supply. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), a class of electrostatic electroactive polymers, allow for kilohertz operation with high power density but require typically several kilovolts to reach full strain. The mass of kilovolt supplies has limited DEA robot speed and performance. In this work, we report low-voltage stacked DEAs (LVSDEAs) with an operating voltage below 450 volts and used them to propel an insect-sized (40 millimeters long) soft untethered and autonomous legged robot. The DEAnsect body, with three LVSDEAs to drive its three legs, weighs 190 milligrams and can carry a 950-milligram payload (five times its body weight). The unloaded DEAnsect moves at 30 millimeters/second and is very robust by virtue of its compliance. The sub–500-volt operation voltage enabled us to develop 780-milligram drive electronics, including optical sensors, a microcontroller, and a battery, for two channels to output 450 volts with frequencies up to 1 kilohertz. By integrating this flexible printed circuit board with the DEAnsect, we developed a subgram robot capable of autonomous navigation, independently following printed paths. This work paves the way for new generations of resilient soft and fast untethered robots.},

The laminate has activated carbon-based electrodes and ionic liquid is used as an electrolyte. Layers of compliant gold foil are used as current collectors. The superior performance of the IEAP laminate is demonstrated by constructing a centimeter-scale robot propelled by a single IEAP actuator. The cyclic locomotion of the robot is inspired by the movements of an inchworm, while the IEAP laminate is used concurrently as an actuator and a structural member. The 830-mg robot is able to crawl on a smooth surface in open air, solely by undulation of its body. The microprocessor-controlled robot has an on-board lithium battery and uses a pulse-width-modulated signal to drive the IEAP actuator. The robot is able to carry its own power supply and even an extra payload.

The use of light-weight batteries and small-volume amplifiers contributes to the development of this untethered soft robot. Inspired by inchworms, this untethered soft robot can achieve locomotion through alternate expansion/contraction of its deformable body and adhesion/detachment of its two paper-based feet. The strong electroadhesion ensures a stable locomotion, and the large voltage-induced deformation and fast response of the robotic body leads to a velocity of 0.02 body length/s. This velocity is higher than that of untethered soft crawling robots based on pneumatic actuators or ionic polymer metal composites. The deformation of the robotic body is studied through finite element analysis. Compared to traditional hard robots, soft robots are found to be more susceptible to dissipative processes, including charging/discharging the actuators, dielectric relaxation and viscoelastic effects.

First, for locomotion, the robot strides by bending its body into an omega shape; anisotropic friction pads enable the robot to move forward using this simple motion. Second, the robot body is made of a single part but has two four-bar mechanisms and one spherical six-bar mechanism; the mechanisms are 2-D patterned into a single piece of composite and folded to become a robot body that weighs less than 1 g and that can crawl and steer. This design does not require the assembly of various mechanisms of the body structure, thereby simplifying the fabrication process. Third, a new concept for using a shape-memory alloy (SMA) coil-spring actuator is proposed; the coil spring is designed to have a large spring index and to work over a large pitch-angle range. This large-index-and-pitch SMA spring actuator cools faster and requires less energy, without compromising the amount of force and displacement that it can produce. Therefore, the frequency and the efficiency of the actuator are improved. A prototype was used to demonstrate that the inchworm-inspired, novel, small-scale, lightweight robot manufactured on a single piece of composite can crawl and steer.},

	abstract = {Compliant mechanisms have become an important branch of modern mechanisms. Unlike conventional rigid body mechanisms, compliant mechanisms transform the displacement and force at least partly through the deformation of their structural components, which can offer a great reduction in friction, lubrication and assemblage. Therefore, compliant mechanisms are particularly suitable for applications in microscale/nanoscale manipulation systems. The significant demand of practical applications has also promoted the development of systematic design methods for compliant mechanisms. Several methods have been developed to design compliant mechanisms. In this paper, we focus on the continuum topology optimization methods and present a survey of the state-of-the-art design advances in this research area over the past 20 years. The presented overview can be helpful to those engaged in the topology optimization of compliant mechanisms who desire to be apprised of the field’s recent state and research tendency.},

	abstract = {We present an efficient Matlab code for structural topology optimization that includes a general finite element routine based on isoparametric polygonal elements which can be viewed as the extension of linear triangles and bilinear quads. The code also features a modular structure in which the analysis routine and the optimization algorithm are separated from the specific choice of topology optimization formulation. Within this framework, the finite element and sensitivity analysis routines contain no information related to the formulation and thus can be extended, developed and modified independently. We address issues pertaining to the use of unstructured meshes and arbitrary design domains in topology optimization that have received little attention in the literature. Also, as part of our examination of the topology optimization problem, we review the various steps taken in casting the optimal shape problem as a sizing optimization problem. This endeavor allows us to isolate the finite element and geometric analysis parameters and how they are related to the design variables of the discrete optimization problem. The Matlab code is explained in detail and numerical examples are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the code.},

	abstract = {A generalized formulation to design Multi-Input–Multi-Output (MIMO) compliant mechanisms is presented in this work. This formulation also covers the simplified cases of the design of Multi-Input and Multi-Output compliant mechanisms, more commonly used in the literature. A Sequential Element Rejection and Admission (SERA) method is used to obtain the optimum design that converts one or more input works into one or more output displacements in predefined directions. The SERA procedure allows material to flow between two different material models: ‘real’ and ‘virtual’. The method works with two separate criteria for the rejection and admission of elements to efficiently achieve the optimum design. Examples of Multi-Input, Multi-Output and MIMO compliant mechanisms are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed procedure to design complex complaint mechanisms.},
