	doi = {10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341497},
	abstract = {Grasping and manipulating objects is an integral part of many robotic systems. Both soft and rigid grippers have been investigated for manipulating objects in a multitude of different roles. Rigid grippers can hold heavy objects and apply large amounts of force, while soft grippers can conform to the size and shape of objects as well as protect fragile objects from excess stress. However, grippers that possess the qualities of both rigid and soft grippers are under-explored. In this paper, we present a novel gripper with two distinct properties: 1) it can vary its stiffness to become either a soft gripper that can conform its shape to fit complex objects or a rigid gripper that can hold a large weight; 2) when the gripper is soft, it has two stable states (i.e., bistable): open and closed: allowing it to be closed without an actuator but through contact force with a target object. The variable stiffness is accomplished by heating a shape memory polymer (SMP) material through its glass transition temperature. The bi-stability is achieved by shaping the gripper's energy landscape through two elastic elements. This paper details the design and fabrication process of this gripper, as well as quantifies the influence of temperature variations on this gripper. The capability of the gripper is experimentally verified by grasping different objects with various shapes and weights. We expect such a gripper to be suitable for many applications that traditionally require either a rigid or a soft gripper.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and control of a novel gripper device with a passive type of compliant constant-force mechanism. The function of constant-force output is achieved by using the combination of a positive-stiffness and a negative-stiffness mechanism. The negative stiffness is generated by a bistable buckled fixed-guided beam. Conventionally, when gripping a target-object using a high-stiffness gripper, both the displacement control and force control are required to prevent the damage of the object. The uniqueness of the developed constant-force gripper is that it can eliminate the dependence on force control while keeping the force constant via its mechanical structure. The gripper performance is evaluated by the established analytical model and nonlinear finite-element analysis, and validated through experimental study on a fabricated prototype. To achieve a precise position output of the gripper jaw, a discrete-time variable structure control strategy based on a nonswitching type of reaching law is realized. The effectiveness of the gripper system is verified by conducting experimental studies on grasp-hold-release operations of a micro copper wire.},

Bistable mechanisms have two force-free stable equilibrium positions in their range of motion, which can hold for a long time without energy consumption. In the present work, a design of bistable system is proposed, consisting of a cross-like shape buckling beam and two conical dielectric elastomer actuators. Analytical model has been developed to analyze the electromechanical coupling behavior of dielectric elastomer and the force-displacement relationship of the cross-like shape buckling beam. The working principle of the bistable conical DEAs is explained in terms of force equilibrium method and internal energy of the system. A bistable dielectric elastomer actuator with a switching force of 0.05 N and a stroke of 5.65 mm is developed to validate the analytical model of the conical DEAs, pre-compressed bistable cross-like beam, and the design.},

	abstract = {Shape memory alloy (SMA) wire-based soft actuators have had their performance limited by the small stroke of the SMA wire embedded within the polymeric matrix. This intrinsically links the bending angle and bending force in a way that made SMA-based soft grippers have relatively poor performance versus other types of soft actuators. In this work, the use of free-sliding SMA wires as tendons for soft actuation is presented that enables large increases in the bending angle and bending force of the actuator by decoupling the length of the matrix and the length of the SMA wires while also allowing for the compact packaging of the driving SMA wires. Bending angles of 400° and tip forces of 0.89 N were achieved by the actuators in this work using a tendon length up to 350 mm. The tendons were integrated as a compact module using bearings that enables the actuator to easily be implemented in various soft gripper configurations. Three fingers were used either in an antagonistic configuration or in a triangular configuration and the gripper was shown to be capable of gripping a wide range of objects weighing up to 1.5 kg and was easily installed on a robotic arm. The maximum pulling force of the gripper was measured to be 30 N.},

The phenomenological models for SMAs, consisting of a thermodynamics-based-constitutive and a phase transformation kinetics model, are the most widely used models for engineering applications. The existing phenomenological models are formulated to qualitatively predict the behavior of SMA systems for simple loadings. In this study, we have shown that there are certain situations in which these models are either not correctly formulated, and therefore are not able, to predict the behavior of SMA wires or the formulation is not straightforward for engineering applications. Such cases most often occur when the temperature and stress of the SMA wire change simultaneously, such as the case of rotary SMA actuators. To this end, a rotary SMA-actuated robotic arm is modeled using the existing constitutive models. The model is verified against the experimental results to document that the model is not able to predict the behavior of the SMA-actuated manipulator, under certain conditions.},

	abstract = {In the present paper two constitutive models, able to reproduce the mechanical behavior of shape memory alloy (SMA), are proposed. The constitutive laws allow considering the simultaneous presence of normal and shear stresses, accounting for its coupling without developing a full three-dimensional (3D) model. In such a way, two different models suitable for deriving the response of SMA devices, both characterized by the presence of only normal and shear stresses, are presented. In particular, the proposed SMA models reproduce the pseudoelastic behavior, the shape memory effect, the reorientation process and account for the different elastic properties of austenite and martensite. The phase transformations are governed by an equivalent stress defined as function of the normal and shear stresses. A robust numerical algorithm, based on a backward Euler time integration within a predictor–corrector technique, is developed for each model. Numerical simulations of experimental evidences, available in literature, are performed to validate the proposed models and computational strategies. In particular, comparisons of the results obtained by the proposed models with experimental data, are performed. A comparison with a 3D model is also carried out. The ability of the proposed models in satisfactorily reproducing the SMA response with reduced computational cost is verified even for complex loading–unloading histories.},

The proposed sensor design utilizes 2-D fabrication processes to create specific profiles and stretchable mesh patterns in Constantan-polyimide laminate that are scalable and customizable. In addition to the geometrical parameters of the stretchable mesh pattern, the sensitivity in the proposed design is determined by the metal layer profile. Without considerably affecting its mechanical properties and stretchability, the profile design allows an engineering freedom to choose the scope of measurements and the sensitivity. Similar design principle can eventually produce complete sensor/circuit systems, where the circuitry and the sensing elements can coexist in a single metal laminate. In this paper, we describe the sensor design parameters and the sensor model that include the equations of deformation and resistance change as a function of the stretch. We compare the prototype test results to the model prediction. The findings provide guideline to designing customized sensors that satisfies specific size and stretch requirements.},

Despite the advantages of SMAs for actuator applications—high strain, silent operation, and mechanical simplicity—the response time and energy efficiency limit overall performance. As an alternative to SMA wires, thin SMA sheets are used to fabricate effective yet compact torsional actuators. Also, instead of using conventional Joule heating, an external Ni–Cr heating element is utilized to focus heat on the regions of highest required strain. Various design parameters and fabrication variants are described and experimentally explored in actuator prototypes. Controlled current profiles and discrete heating produces a 20\% faster response time with 40\% less power consumption as compared to Joule heating in a low-profile (sub-millimeter) torsional actuator capable of 180° motion.},

In this study, analytical models predicting melt pool dimensions and defect formation criteria were synergistically used to develop processing maps demonstrating boundary conditions for the formation of such defects, as balling, keyhole-induced pores, and lack of fusion. Experimental validation has demonstrated that this method can provide an accurate estimation and guide manufacturability of defect-free Nitinol alloys. Moreover, the crack formation phenomena were experimentally analysed, which showed that a low linear energy density (El) should be chosen to avoid cracks in the optimized process windows.

The aim of the work was the manipulation of small, almost cylindrical objects, e.g. test tubes, by a device having small overall dimensions. A parametric study of four different, but similar, ﬁngers was conducted with the aim of obtaining a solution with a good ampliﬁcation ratio and a gripping force almost constant during closure. The use of ﬂexure hinges simpliﬁes the design, but limits the ﬁnger range of motion. Moreover, it was possible to ﬁnd a conﬁguration with sufﬁcient work space. Once the ﬁnger geometry was deﬁned, the whole hand was then designed with the aim of producing a compact hand contained in a cylindrical volume (φ 65×h 65 mm), and the ﬁrst prototype was built. Preliminary tests demonstrated its good dimensioning and the success of some technological solutions. The experimental transmission ratio was almost the same as the theoretical one. Some drawbacks have been highlighted, such as a reduced range of motion and incomplete backstroke; future studies will deal with them.},

Fabrication at micro-scale presents an important challenge: due to non-symmetrical lamination of the structures, out-of-plane bending spoils the behavior of the grippers. Suppression of this out-of-plane deformation is the main novelty introduced in this work. In addition, a robust approach is used to control length scale in the whole domain and to reduce sensitivity of the design to small fabrication errors. Geometrically non-linear modeling is used for the in-plane deformations whereas out-of-plane motions are modeled by a linear, un-coupled plate model to save computational time. Model and resulting designs are validated by subsequent 3D geometrically non-linear modeling.},

As a key mechanism which functions to guide wobbling motion, a planar XY compliant mechanism is designed and applied to the motor. Since the mechanism has monolithic flat structure with the planar mirror symmetric configuration, cyclic expansion and contraction of the SMA wires could be reliably converted into high-torque rotary motion. For systematic design of the motor, a characterization of electro-thermomechanical behavior of the SMA wire is experimentally carried out, and the design parametric analysis is conducted to determine parametric values of the XY compliant mechanism. The designed motor is fabricated as a functional prototype to experimentally investigate its operational feasibility and working performances.

Their locomotion, involving arching of much of the central portion of their body length, has not been studied as extensively as the peristaltic locomotion of worms or the crawling locomotion of many other caterpillars. A mathematical model is developed to describe the shapes and bending strains of typical inchworm motions. The inchworm is assumed to travel in a straight line on a rigid horizontal substrate. Two basic types of cycles are considered. In Case I, the inchworm body arches and then reverses that motion in becoming flat again. In Case II, the body arches, then cantilevers upward, and then falls down to a flat shape. A continuum model based on an elastica is adopted. The results may be useful in the development of soft robots exhibiting an inchworm mode of motion.},

Shape memory alloy wires were embedded longitudinally in a soft polymer to imitate the longitudinal muscle fibers that control the abdominal contractions of the inchworm during locomotion. Each foot of the robot has three segments with different friction coefficients to implement the anchor and sliding movement. Then, utilizing actuation patterns between the body and feet based on the looping gait, the robot achieves a biomimetic inchworm gait. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the robot’s locomotive performance for both linear locomotion and turning movement. Results show that the proposed robot’s stride length was nearly one third of its body length, with a maximum linear speed of 3.6 mm s−1, a linear locomotion efficiency of 96.4\%, a maximum turning capability of 4.3 degrees per stride, and a turning locomotion efficiency of 39.7\%.},

	abstract = {Shape memory alloys are a class of smart materials that can recover their original shape by heating above a temperature called austenite transformation temperature when subjected to deformation at low temperature. This property enables the shape memory alloy to be used as a unique actuator. Also, the material’s resistance changes during transformation. Thus, the change in resistance and other electrical properties can be used to sense the deformation, which eliminates the requirement of additional sensors. An artificial neural network, described in our earlier study, was able to accurately model the relationship between the electrical properties and manipulator position. This study aims to develop a control methodology of a shape memory alloy–actuated rotary manipulator using the feedback signal from the previously developed artificial neural network model, thus eliminating the need of any external position sensor. The control methodology using variable structure control technique is experimentally tested under different conditions. Also, the effect of environmental temperature on the ability of artificial neural network to predict manipulator position is analyzed using phenomenological model simulations. It is concluded that this system gives a robust performance with a small tolerance (less than 5°) and can operate well even when the ambient temperature changes considerably.},

In this study, the resistance model is considered the material properties of austenite, martensite, and their phase transforms. In addition, the effect of the temperature in the SMA is considered by the heat transfer model. The position is computed using the applied voltage and current signals through the constructed electric resistance and heat transfer models. Based on the estimated position, a sensorless feedback control system is designed.

Among those are devices such as precision balances and mass comparators with achievable resolutions and uncertainties in the nano-newton range. The exact knowledge of the mechanical properties of notch hinges and their modeling is essential for the design and the goal-oriented adjustment of these devices. It is shown in this article that many analytical equations available in the literature for calculating the bending stiffness of thin semi-circular flexure hinges cause deviations of up to 12\% compared to simulation results based on the three-dimensional finite element model for the considered parameter range. A close examination of the stress state within the loaded hinge reveals possible reasons for this deviation. The article explains this phenomenon in detail and shows the limitations of existing analytical models depending on specific geometric ratios. An accurate determination of the bending stiffness of semi-circular flexure hinges in a wide range of geometric parameters without the need for an elaborate finite element analysis is proposed in form of FEM-based correction factors for analytical equations referring to Euler-Bernoulli\&rsquo;s beam theory.},

	abstract = {The focus of this paper is on the practical aspects of design, prototyping, and testing of a compact, compliant external pipe-crawling robot that can inspect a closely spaced bundle of pipes in hazardous environments and areas that are inaccessible to humans. The robot consists of two radially deployable compliant ring actuators that are attached to each other along the longitudinal axis of the pipe by a bidirectional linear actuator. The robot imitates the motion of an inchworm. The novel aspect of the compliant ring actuator is a spring-steel compliant mechanism that converts circumferential motion to radial motion of its multiple gripping pads. Circumferential motion to ring actuators is provided by two shape memory alloy (SMA) wires that are guided by insulating rollers. The design of the compliant mechanism is derived from a radially deployable mechanism. A unique feature of the design is that the compliant mechanism provides the necessary kinematic function within the limited annular space around the pipe and serves as the bias spring for the SMA wires. The robot has a control circuit that sequentially activates the SMA wires and the linear actuator; it also controls the crawling speed. The robot has been fabricated, tested, and automated. Its crawling speed is about 45 mm/min, and the weight is about 150 g. It fits within an annular space of a radial span of 15 mm to crawl on a pipe of 60-mm outer diameter.},

	abstract = {Within industrial manufacturing manufacturing, most processing steps are accompanied by transporting and positioning of workpieces. The active interfaces between handling system and workpiece are industrial grippers, which often are driven by pneumaticspneumatics. On the way to bett er energy efficiency and digi digitalization, companies are looking for new actuation technologies with more sensor integration and higher efficiencies. Commonly used actuators like solenoids and electric engines are in many cases too heavy and large for direct integration into the grippin g system. Shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators are suited to overcome those drawbacks of conventional actuation systems, because of their high energy density. Additionally, they feature self self-sensing abilities that lead to sensor sensorless monitoring and control of the actuator element. Another drawback of conventional grippers is their design, which is based on moving parts with linear guides and bearings. These parts are prone to wear, especially in abrasive environments. This can be improved by a compliant gripper design that is based on flexure hinges and thus dispenses with joints, bearings and guides. In the presented work, the development process of a functional prototype for a compliant gripper driven by a bistable SMA actuat or for industrial applications is outlined. The focus lies on the development of the compliant kinematics, where first results of FEM simulation are discussed. As a result, a working gripper gripper-prototype which is manufactured with modern 3D-printing technologies is introduced introduced.},

Based on the anatomy of C. elegans, a 12-unit robot was designed to generate a sinusoidal undulating motion. Each body unit consisting of a pair of SMA actuators is serially connected by rigid links with an embedded motion control circuit. A simple binary operation-based motion control mechanism was implemented using a microcontroller. The assembled robot can execute C. elegans-like motion with a 0.17 Hz undulation frequency.

	abstract = {During mechanical loading–unloading cycles shape-memory alloys (SMA) are able to undergo large deformations without showing residual strains (pseudoelasticity) or recovering them through thermal cycles (shape memory effect). Motivated by stress-induced solid phase transformations, these unique behaviours induce the SMA exploitation in innovative and commercially valuable applications, stimulating, consequently, the interest in the development of constitutive models. Also if many models are now available in the literature, effective three-dimensional proposals are still few and limited in several aspects. In this paper, a three-dimensional thermomechanical model recently proposed by Souza et al. (European Journal of Mechanics–A/Solids, 1998; 17: 789–806.) is taken into consideration; such a model is of particular interest for its effectiveness and flexibility, but it also shows some limitations and missing links in the algorithmical counterparts.

Therefore, the transformation kinetics formulation is essential for predicting the thermo-mechanical behavior of SMAs. In this work, we show that previous models, including the Brinson model, which is the most widely used one-dimensional phenomenological model, cannot describe the compressive thermo-mechanical behavior of SMAs due to the tension–compression asymmetry. In addition, a new transformation kinetics is derived which precisely predicts the compressive behavior of SMAs based on the following experimental results: (1) drastic variation exists during transformation, and the plastic deformation is not ignored in compression; (2) the plastic deformation increases in proportion to the volume fraction of detwinned martensite; and (3) the critical stress–temperature slopes largely increase and the slopes of the start and finish temperatures of each phase are not identical to each other. Finally, numerical calculations using the suggested transformation equation are conducted to verify its capability through a comparison with the compressive experimental results. According to the results, the suggested transformation kinetics can predict the thermo-mechanical behavior of SMAs more precisely under compression.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to review the current application areas of shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators in intelligent robotic systems and devices. Design/methodology/approach – This paper analyses how actuation and sensing functions of the SMA actuator have been exploited and incorporated in micro and macro robotic devices, developed for medical and non‐medical applications. The speed of response of SMA actuator mostly depends upon its shape and size, addition and removal of heat and the bias force applied. All these factors have impact on the overall size of the robotic device and the degree of freedom (dof) obtained and hence, a comprehensive survey is made highlighting these aspects. Also described are the mechatronic aspects like the software and hardware used in an industrial environment for the control of such nonlinear actuator and the type of sensory feedback devices incorporated for obtaining better control, positioning accuracy and fast response. Findings – SMA actuators find wide applications in various facets of robotic equipments. Selecting a suitable shape, fast heating and cooling method and better intelligent control technique with or without feedback devices could optimize its performance. Research limitations/implications – The frequency of SMA actuation purely depends on the rate of heat energy added to and removed from the actuator, which in turn depends upon interrelated nonlinear parameters. Practical implications – For increasing the dof of robots, number of actuators also have to be increased that leads to complex control problems. Originality/value – Explains the suitability of SMA as actuators in smart robotic systems, possibility of miniaturisation. It also highlights the difficulties faced by the SMA research community.},

Due to this macroscopic behavior, not present in traditional materials, shape-memory alloys are exploited in innovative applications, often requiring the use of design tools. The present work proposes an efficient and robust solution algorithm to be used during the design of SMA-based devices through the use of classical computational tools such as the finite element method. To reach this goal, we review a constitutive model able to reproduce the superelastic behavior at finite strains. We then discuss a solution algorithm for the corresponding time-discrete model. Cast within the return-map family, the adopted approach pays particular attention to the overall algorithmic robustness and to the possibility of an efficient implementation. To properly test the proposed approach, we start solving a series of severe one-dimensional tests. We then also simulate a complex three-dimensional problem, relative to an orthodontic archwire.},

Conversely, exploitation of the shape memory effect for building solid-state actuators is still characterized by a trial-and-error approach. Although the thermomechanical phenomena behind the behavior of shape memory alloys (SMAs) are theoretically well-known, there is an open challenge for engineering methods to help the designer capitalize on these alloys to develop smart devices. This chapter describes research aimed at identifying simple but effective design rules for SMA-based actuators and motors, linear and rotary. The presentation concentrates on the development of SMA devices, which try to overcome the stroke limitations of conventional actuators without compromising with the force generated. It will be shown that the class of passive mechanical springs can be fruitfully turned into intelligent high-performance devices upon replacement of the material with an SMA. Alternatively, widely available SMA wires can be used smartly in compact designs with unconventional architecture. The basic theoretical model behind the design of unconventional devices will be addressed, together with laboratory prototypes demonstrating the feasibility of all of the concepts explored.},

The numerical model is designed by comprehensively considering the factors that significantly affect an SMA actuator's strain-cycling frequency, i.e., heat convection methods, constant or nonconstant bias loads, and Joule heating methods. For computing strain cycles of SMA actuators, we develop a computation framework that effectively integrates an SMA constitutive model, a phase transformation kinetic model, stress-strain models for different types of bias stress, and a heat transfer model of SMA wires. The strain and temperature rates are formulated by nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The strain and temperature cycles can be accurately approximated by numerical iterative methods. Experimental verification was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model. By initially identifying the SMA characteristic parameters, we employed Latin hypercube sampling method to generate 30 sets of design parameters for comparing the predicted and measured actuation frequencies. In addition, we investigated how the uncertainty of premeasured SMA characteristic parameters affect the numerical prediction of actuation frequency by conducting sensitivity analysis. The experiments demonstrate \$0.7\%{\textbackslash}text–9.03\%\$ and \$2.65\%{\textbackslash}text–17.57\%\$ differences between predicted and measured actuation frequencies for constant bias loads and spring bias loads, respectively.},

	abstract = {Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are popular as actuators for soft bioinspired robots because they are naturally compliant, have high work density, and can be operated using miniaturized on-board electronics for power and control. However, SMA actuators typically exhibit limited bandwidth due to the long duration of time required for the alloy to cool down and return to its natural shape and compliance following electrical actuation. This challenge is addressed by constructing SMA-based actuators out of thermally conductive elastomers and examining the influence of electrical current and actuation frequency on blocking force, bending amplitude, and operating temperature. The actuator is composed of a U-shape SMA wire that is sandwiched between layers of stretched and unstretched thermal elastomer. Based on the studies, the ability is demonstrated to create a highly dynamic soft actuator that weighs 3.7 g, generates a force of ≈0.2 N, bends with curvature change of ≈60 m−1 in 0.15 s, and can be activated with a frequency above 0.3 Hz with a pair of miniature 3.7 V lithium–polymer batteries. Together, these properties allow the actuator to be used as an “artificial muscle” for a variety of tethered and untethered soft robotic systems capable of fast dynamic locomotion.},

The mechanical design of the gripper is presented and each component is expounded in details. Multiple SMA wires are connected in series to achieve a larger stroke of the actuator. A light-weight, small-volume cross-shear hinge coupler is designed to ensure the symmetry and synchronism of the movement of the two gripping arms. In order to evaluate the working performance of the proposed SMA gripper, three theoretical models are developed for bias element selection, gripping force calculation and capture range analysis. A prototype of the gripper is fabricated and a series of experiments are conducted. The actuation characteristics under different bias forces and different currents are tested. The relationship between the gripping force and the sizes of targets are compared. The experimental observations are in good agreement with the theoretical results which demonstrates the correctness of the proposed models. Research results indicate that the proposed SMA gripper can grasp targets reliably and adaptively.},

The effect of the initial bending angle due to the curvature of the actuator and of non-uniform initial curvatures on the maximum bending angle was tested. A model based on the thermoconstitutive model of SMA with a geometrical analysis of the deformation of the actuator was used to estimate the effect of the initial curvature on the maximum bending angle of the actuator. Finally, multiple curved actuators were implemented as a simple gripper and the lifting force of straight and curved actuators were compared, and the curved gripper has a lifting force nearly three times larger than the straight gripper. This type of concept can be used to tailor the force, deformed shape and maximum deformation of SMA actuators.},

There are many features that are commonly found in cars that utilize electromechanical type actuators. Power mirrors are one such application that has been becoming more and more standard on cars today. A cost effective mirror actuator was designed and built that utilizes shape memory alloy (SMA) wires to position the external side mirrors. This paper present a second generation SMA-actuated mirror. A robust control algorithm is developed for the mirror to provide stable and accurate positioning. This variable structure controller provides accurate positioning without adding unnecessary complexity to the computational requirements for the mirror. Experimental results are compiled to show the tracking response of the SMA mirror actuator.},

	abstract = {The continuous advance in mechatronics has long attracted researchers toward the development of new highly integrated actuators for automotive applications where reduced space and low weight are common constraints. In this context, Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) offer many peculiar characteristics that make this technology very attractive for the construction of miniature mechatronic actuators. This paper presents the design, the prototype fabrication, and the functional testing of a case study, where an SMA binary actuator is used for automotive tumble flaps. The innovative solid-state actuation system is proposed as an alternative to electromagnetic and pneumatic effectors, traditionally used to drive the tumble shaft of an air intake manifold for internal combustion engines. Original features of the linear actuator involve the mechanical architecture and the control structure. On the mechanical side, two contrasting sets of SMA springs are used to actively generate the net actuating force during both out-stroke and in-stroke. On the control side, a current feedback is exploited for sensorless real-time monitoring of the working temperature of the SMA springs during electrical supply. Major shortcomings of the proposed solution are a low response time and a power consumption higher than pneumatic and electromagnetic counterparts.},

	abstract = {A review of recent shape memory alloy (SMA) aeronautical applications is highlighted. To date, SMAs have not been successfully employed in critical aircraft actuation due to several technological and infrastructure challenges. Albeit fully functional SMA prototypes were demonstrated in aerospace environments over a decade ago, other critical elements such as material form, certification, and other crucial design tools have not progressed with the same level of maturity. The applications presented here have acknowledged these shortcomings and are built on previous successes to thrust SMAs a step closer to aircraft adoption. The spanwise adaptive wing (SAW) project and the wind tunnel remote control actuation (RCA) are the new applications that employ new advancement. First, the SAW project is the first ever, fully integrated flight test employing high-temperature SMAs with flight-relevant properties. The project utilized NiTiHf alloys with suitable actuation temperatures, and scalable to commercially available lots/forms. Second, the RCA project represents the next paradigm shift in wind tunnel testing. This application employs NiTi torque tubes capable of moving and controlling the model parts, enabling increased productivity, improved data quality, and reduced cost of wind tunnel testing. An overview of each application is provided here, with insights into system-level successes, challenges, and lessons learned.},

The flexibility, long-term endurance and thermal characteristics of this system were studied. The system consisted of 3 segments, front, middle and back. Thermal simulations showed an increase in temperature of 1–2 °C at the segment nearest to the activated segment and a temperature increase of 1 °C at the segment furthest from the activated segment. Transformation strain simulations showed that the 8 mm width design has the lowest strain (2\%). The average maximum bending angle was above 30° across most actuator segments but a reformation angle of only 50\% of the maximum angle. The endurance test showed that all actuators can operate for 7000 actuation cycles with a standard deviation of 0.6154, 0.8293 and 0.0364 mm for sections A, B and C, respectively. The system was capable of high angle of bending across all segments and capable of continuous long-term use with little performance deviation. The system will allow surgeons to have more flexibility during surgery and thus enable reaching difficult regions in minimally invasive surgery.},

Inspired by the mechanical properties of 1-D SMA materials, a set of SMA wires are employed to drive an eyelid wiper that is concealed in the module's edge. By analyzing the actuation mechanism, we provide a design guideline for developing a functional modular actuator. A numerical computation model is also proposed to predict the actuation cycles according to various combinations of design parameters. The performance of an initial prototype is experimentally evaluated by introducing three different contamination sources, i.e., fogging, bone dusts, and blood. The predicted actuation cycle is experimentally validated with 95.2\% prediction accuracy. And the actuation cycle of the eyelid wiper is about 2 s.},

	abstract = {An ultrastretchable film device is developed that can follow the shape of spherical and large deformable biological samples such as heart and brain tissues. Although the film is composed of biocompatible parylene for the device substrate and metal layers of platinum (Pt)/titanium (Ti), which are unstretchable materials, the film shows a high stretchability by patterning slits as a “Kirigami” design. A Pt/Ti-microelectrode array embedded in 11 µm thick parylene film with 5 × 91 slits exhibits a film strain of ≈250\% at 9 mN strain-force (0.08 MPa in stress) with a Young's modulus of 23 kPa, while the 3 × 91-slit film shows a Young's modulus of 3.6 kPa. The maximum strains of these devices are ≈470\% and ≈840\%, respectively. It is demonstrated that the Kirigami-based microelectrode device can simultaneously record in vivo electrocorticogram signals from the visual and barrel cortices of a mouse by stretching the film and tuning the electrode gap. Moreover, wrapping the Kirigami device around a beating mouse's heart, which shows large and rapid changes in the volume and the surface area, can record the in vivo epicardial electrocardiogram signals. Such a small Young's modulus for a stretchable device reduces the device's strain-force, minimizing the device-induced stress to soft biological tissues.},

	abstract = {Flying insects capable of navigating in highly cluttered natural environments can withstand in-flight collisions because of the combination of their low inertia1 and the resilience of their wings2, exoskeletons1 and muscles. Current insect-scale (less than ten centimetres long and weighing less than five grams) aerial robots3–6 use rigid microscale actuators, which are typically fragile under external impact. Biomimetic artificial muscles7–10 that are capable of large deformation offer a promising alternative for actuation because they can endure the stresses caused by such impacts. However, existing soft actuators11–13 have not yet demonstrated sufficient power density to achieve lift-off, and their actuation nonlinearity and limited bandwidth create further challenges for achieving closed-loop (driven by an input control signal that is adjusted based on sensory feedback) flight control. Here we develop heavier-than-air aerial robots powered by soft artificial muscles that demonstrate open-loop (driven by a predetermined signal without feedback), passively stable (upright during flight) ascending flight as well as closed-loop, hovering flight. The robots are driven by multi-layered dielectric elastomer actuators that weigh 100 milligrams each and have a resonance frequency of 500 hertz and power density of 600 watts per kilogram. To increase the mechanical power output of the actuator and to demonstrate flight control, we present ways to overcome challenges unique to soft actuators, such as nonlinear transduction and dynamic buckling. These robots can sense and withstand collisions with surrounding obstacles and can recover from in-flight collisions by exploiting material robustness and vehicle passive stability. We also fly two micro-aerial vehicles simultaneously in a cluttered environment. They collide with the wall and each other without suffering damage. These robots rely on offboard amplifiers and an external motion-capture system to provide power to the dielectric elastomer actuators and to control their flight. Our work demonstrates how soft actuators can achieve sufficient power density and bandwidth to enable controlled flight, illustrating the potential of developing next-generation agile soft robots.},

	abstract = {Aerial grasping empowers unmanned aerial vehicles to find applications beyond structured logistics. However, it brings a number of challenges including inaccurate positioning of the end effector and limited energy sources. Moreover, solutions so far have difficulty in handling a variety of objects. A novel closed structure compliant gripper was developed to address the challenges above. The gripper has a large self-centering work envelope and is normally-closed for passive grasping. Introduction of compliance as a form of morphological computation was also considered to enhance grasping capabilities, where multi-material 3D printing would facilitate rapid design changes based on target application. To grasp different objects, the gripper has hot-swappable 3D printed fingertips which are optimized with a multi-objective Bayesian Optimization process using physical bench experiments mimicking drone grasping and ascent on a common object set. The morphology of the fingertip including tip width, curvature and distribution of soft and hard material on contact surface, are optimized with a bench test that mimics quadcopter takeoff and landing. The best design from optimization shows an improvement of more than 10\% from the initial design in successful grasp operations, demonstrated by field tests with a quadcopter.},

A variable stiffness mechanism with embedded sets of SMA fibers was developed; however, the response characteristics of its backbone did not comply with the constant-curvature model when it was subjected to complex forces/torques, such as gravity, grasping forces and driving torques. In this case, the Cosserat theory was used to implement real-time computations of the grasping force of the soft robotic gripper that was subjected to complex forces. Finally, a series of tests were conducted on the grasping force of the soft finger and the gripper. The elicited results showed that the grasping force is related to the stiffness and to the object's offset and friction coefficient. Moreover, experimental results showed that the grasping force of the soft robotic gripper increased by 48.7\% when the Young's modulus of the SMA-2 wires increased from 25 GPa to 48 GPa.},

Here, by taking inspiration from kirigami—the Japanese art of paper cutting—we show that a network of notches6,7,8 made in rigid nanocomposite and other composite sheets by top-down patterning techniques prevents unpredictable local failure and increases the ultimate strain of the sheets from 4 to 370\%. We also show that the sheets’ tensile behaviour can be accurately predicted through finite-element modelling. Moreover, in marked contrast to other stretchable conductors3,4,5, the electrical conductance of the stretchable kirigami sheets is maintained over the entire strain regime, and we demonstrate their use to tune plasma-discharge phenomena. The unique properties of kirigami nanocomposites as plasma electrodes open up a wide range of novel technological solutions for stretchable electronics and optoelectronic devices, among other application possibilities.},

While there is a considerable body of research documented on the cyclic fatigue of Nitinol in uniaxial tension or bending, there remains an almost total lack of comprehensive fatigue lifetime data for other loading conditions, such as torsion and tension/torsion. In this work, thin-walled Nitinol tubes were cycled in torsion at various mean and alternating strains to investigate the fatigue life behavior of Nitinol and results compared to equivalent fatigue data collected under uniaxial tensile/bending loads. Using these strain-life results for various loading modes and an equivalent referential (Lagrangian) strain approach, a strategy for normalizing these data is presented. Based on this strategy, a fatigue lifetime prediction model for the multiaxial loading of Nitinol is presented utilizing a modified Coffin–Manson approach where the number of cycles to failure is related to the equivalent alternating transformation strain.},

A parametric study of four different, but similar, ﬁngers was conducted with the aim of obtaining a solution with a good ampliﬁcation ratio and a gripping force almost constant during closure. The use of ﬂexure hinges simpliﬁes the design, but limits the ﬁnger range of motion. Moreover, it was possible to ﬁnd a conﬁguration with sufﬁcient work space.

Preliminary tests demonstrated its good dimensioning and the success of some technological solutions. The experimental transmission ratio was almost the same as the theoretical one.

	abstract = {Binary systems can lead to simple and efficient robotic and mechatronic systems since such systems use a large number of simple bistable actuators to affect its state. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are prime candidates for use in binary systems since they are simple, low cost, and lightweight. However, previously proposed bistable DEAs (flip-flop) have relatively low volumetric energy density that limits their use in practical devices. This paper investigates the potential of improving the energy density of bistable designs by employing DEAs in compact antagonistic configurations. To do so, two antagonistic configurations (linear and rotating) are designed and studied using an experimentally validated Bergstrom–Boyce viscoelastic material model. The proposed antagonistic configurations show up to ∼10× higher volumetric energy densities than flip-flop designs. This represents a significant advantage for DEA reliability, since, based on volumetric energy density, antagonist actuators require the manufacturing of significantly less film layers than flip-flop designs.

	abstract = {Micro aerial vehicles (MAV) with multiple rotors, or multicopters, have many promising applications ranging from environmental monitoring, agricultural inspection, to package delivery. These applications, however, usually face a critical problem: the flight time of MAVs is limited due to the low aerodynamic efficiency and high energy consumption. One promising solution is to make them rest on desired objects using perching, an important capability in biological flyers (e.g., birds). In this paper, we present the design and experimentation of a novel perching mechanism: a low cost, 3D printed gripper with bistability (i.e., two stable states). The gripper has two unique characteristics. First, using bistability, it can passively switch from open to closed state using the impact between the gripper and the perching object, alleviating the requirement for precise motion control. Second, the gripper has two perching methods for different objects. For objects with a small height, it can form a closed diamond shape to encircle the objects (encircling method). For objects with a large height, the gripper's two fingers can clip on each side of the objects to utilize the friction forces for perching (clipping method). We analyze the proposed gripper design to predict the required force for opening and closing the gripper. We also predict the size of objects that will allow for successful perching for the clipping method. All the theoretical analyses are experimentally verified. Finally, we integrate the gripper onto a palm-size quadcopter to enable a mechatronic system for perching, and demonstrate successful perching with both clipping and encircling methods as well as aerial grasping. Although our bistable gripper is used with a palm-size quadcopter, the design strategy can also be applied to large-size MAVs for both energy efficient perching and aerial grasping.},

We propose two architectures, both based on parallel leaf springs, then evaluate their isotropy defect using firstly an analytic model, secondly finite element analysis and thirdly experimental data measured from physical prototypes. Using these results, we analyze the isotropy defect in terms of displacement, radial distance, angular separation, stiffness and linearity. Based on this analysis, we propose improved architectures stacking in parallel or in series duplicate copies of the original mechanisms rotated at specific angles to cancel isotropy defect. We show that using the mechanisms in pairs reduces isotropy defect by one to two orders of magnitude.},

The state of the art recalls the abundant literature published on the parallel leaf spring stage, and presents the few articles found dealing with the parallel spring stages. The theoretical modeling for the calculation of the linear stiffness of the parallel spring stage is described. The starting point of the discussion is the observation that the theoretical model which is valid when applied to stages of large dimensions produces large errors when applied to wire-EDM machined flexures of very thin cross-sections. As an explanation of this observation, a hypothesis is put forward: on the surface of each neck a thin layer affected by the EDM process is not playing any mechanical role in the bending of the flexure and the thickness of this layer is related to the roughness of the surface. The experimental results show that the hypothesis is true to a large extent but that roughness is probably not the only factor affecting the neutral zone. The 'white layer' and the microstructural homogeneity of the material used could also be determinant.},

Micromechanical properties such as beam deformation, pivot position and pivot shift are investigated and compared with the virtual pivot formed by a cantilever beam. It is shown that the real pivot has negligible shift when subjected to load and fabrication error owing to its feature of structural symmetry, while the virtual pivot suffers from significant pivot shift, which would severely limit the wavelength tuning range. The two pivot designs are implemented into MEMS tuning structures that are fabricated by deep etching and released using a dry release approach. The real pivot measures a depth variation of 16\% over the double-clamped beam but maintains the symmetry to the midpoint, and is still able to produce a rotation angle of 4.7deg. In contrast, the virtual pivot has a depth reduction of 4\% over the cantilever beam, but achieves only a 2.4deg rotation due to the pull-in problem originated from the severe pivot shift. The real pivot design is more suitable for the MEMS tunable lasers as it is simple, symmetric, robust, and suitable for single-chip integration},

This kind of robotic system utilizes complex hardware and firmware for sensing and planning. To reduce computational cost and increase reliability for a robotic system, employing mechanical components to fully or partially take over control tasks is a promising way, which is also referred to as “mechanical intelligence” (MI). This paper proposes a shape memory alloy driven robot capable of using a reciprocating motion to crawl over a surface without any use of electronic controller. A mechanical logic switch is designed to determine the activation timing for a pair of antagonistic shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators. Meanwhile, a compliant pre-strain bistable mechanism is introduced to cooperate with the SMA actuators achieving reliable reciprocating motion between the two stable positions. The SMA actuator is modeled base on a static two-state theory while the bistable mechanism is described by combining a pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM) with a Bi-beam constraint model (Bi-BCM). Following this, the design parameters of the bistable mechanism and SMA actuators are determined according to theoretical simulations. Finally, a robotic prototype is fabricated using anisotropic friction on its feet to convert the reciprocating motion of the actuator to uni-directional locomotion of the robot body over a surface. Experiments are carried out to validate the presented design concept and the modeling methods.},

Therefore, a perfect wireless micro robot comprising telemetry and batteries is realized using only one SMA spring actuator and one silicone bellow. The SMA actuator and bellow play a role in contraction and extension of an earthworm muscle respectively. Based on theoretical analysis, specifications of a SMA actuator and a bellow are properly selected. For temporal stopping, setae of earthworm mimicked claws are employed. On the issue of control, the proposed robot is controlled according to On/Off signal via wireless communication. The operation is customized through tuning of on-/off-time of an actuator and using different type batteries such as a lithium, silver oxide and alkaline battery.

Based on the antagonistic configuration between the shape memory alloy actuator and the elastic body, a vertically auxiliary spring was adopted to enhance the interaction mechanism. Force and kinematic analysis was undertaken, focusing on the parametric design of the special foot configuration. A miniature robot prototype was then 3D-printed (54 mm in length and 9.77 g in weight), using tailored thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer as the body material. A series of experimental tests and evaluations were carried out to assess its performance under different conditions. The results demonstrated that under appropriate actuation conditions, the compact robot prototype could accomplish a relative speed of 0.024 BL/s (with a stride length equivalent to 27\% of its body length) and bear a load over five times to its own weight.},

	abstract = {Insects are a constant source of inspiration for roboticists. Their compliant bodies allow them to squeeze through small openings and be highly resilient to impacts. However, making subgram autonomous soft robots untethered and capable of responding intelligently to the environment is a long-standing challenge. One obstacle is the low power density of soft actuators, leading to small robots unable to carry their sense and control electronics and a power supply. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), a class of electrostatic electroactive polymers, allow for kilohertz operation with high power density but require typically several kilovolts to reach full strain. The mass of kilovolt supplies has limited DEA robot speed and performance. In this work, we report low-voltage stacked DEAs (LVSDEAs) with an operating voltage below 450 volts and used them to propel an insect-sized (40 millimeters long) soft untethered and autonomous legged robot. The DEAnsect body, with three LVSDEAs to drive its three legs, weighs 190 milligrams and can carry a 950-milligram payload (five times its body weight). The unloaded DEAnsect moves at 30 millimeters/second and is very robust by virtue of its compliance. The sub–500-volt operation voltage enabled us to develop 780-milligram drive electronics, including optical sensors, a microcontroller, and a battery, for two channels to output 450 volts with frequencies up to 1 kilohertz. By integrating this flexible printed circuit board with the DEAnsect, we developed a subgram robot capable of autonomous navigation, independently following printed paths. This work paves the way for new generations of resilient soft and fast untethered robots.},

	abstract = {We report here the development of an actuator with an ionic electromechanically active polymer (IEAP) laminate that is exclusively designed to exhibit a combination of high electrically induced strain and high bending modulus. The newly constructed laminate is one of the few IEAPs meeting the requirements for use in miniature soft robotics. The laminate has activated carbon-based electrodes and ionic liquid is used as an electrolyte. Layers of compliant gold foil are used as current collectors. The superior performance of the IEAP laminate is demonstrated by constructing a centimeter-scale robot propelled by a single IEAP actuator. The cyclic locomotion of the robot is inspired by the movements of an inchworm, while the IEAP laminate is used concurrently as an actuator and a structural member. The 830-mg robot is able to crawl on a smooth surface in open air, solely by undulation of its body. The microprocessor-controlled robot has an on-board lithium battery and uses a pulse-width-modulated signal to drive the IEAP actuator. The robot is able to carry its own power supply and even an extra payload. The constructed biomimetic robot is distinctive for the use of a non-planar actuator whose shape is programmed during the manufacturing process.},

Composites consisting of silicone elastomer, polyaramid fabric, and hollow glass microspheres were used to fabricate a sufficiently large soft robot to carry the miniature air compressors, battery, valves, and controller needed for autonomous operation. Fabrication techniques were developed to mold a 0.65-meter-long soft body with modified Pneu-Net actuators capable of operating at the elevated pressures (up to 138 kPa) required to actuate the legs of the robot and hold payloads of up to 8 kg. The soft robot is safe to interact with during operation, and its silicone body is innately resilient to a variety of adverse environmental conditions including snow, puddles of water, direct (albeit limited) exposure to flames, and the crushing force of being run over by an automobile.},

The robot consists of a deformable body driven by dielectric elastomer actuators, and two paper-based feet driven by electroadhesion actuators. The use of light-weight batteries and small-volume amplifiers contributes to the development of this untethered soft robot. Inspired by inchworms, this untethered soft robot can achieve locomotion through alternate expansion/contraction of its deformable body and adhesion/detachment of its two paper-based feet. The strong electroadhesion ensures a stable locomotion, and the large voltage-induced deformation and fast response of the robotic body leads to a velocity of 0.02 body length/s. This velocity is higher than that of untethered soft crawling robots based on pneumatic actuators or ionic polymer metal composites. The deformation of the robotic body is studied through finite element analysis. Compared to traditional hard robots, soft robots are found to be more susceptible to dissipative processes, including charging/discharging the actuators, dielectric relaxation and viscoelastic effects. These dissipative effects on this untethered soft robot are also investigated in this paper.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes three design concepts for developing a crawling robot inspired by an inchworm, called the Omegabot. First, for locomotion, the robot strides by bending its body into an omega shape; anisotropic friction pads enable the robot to move forward using this simple motion. Second, the robot body is made of a single part but has two four-bar mechanisms and one spherical six-bar mechanism; the mechanisms are 2-D patterned into a single piece of composite and folded to become a robot body that weighs less than 1 g and that can crawl and steer. This design does not require the assembly of various mechanisms of the body structure, thereby simplifying the fabrication process. Third, a new concept for using a shape-memory alloy (SMA) coil-spring actuator is proposed; the coil spring is designed to have a large spring index and to work over a large pitch-angle range. This large-index-and-pitch SMA spring actuator cools faster and requires less energy, without compromising the amount of force and displacement that it can produce. Therefore, the frequency and the efficiency of the actuator are improved. A prototype was used to demonstrate that the inchworm-inspired, novel, small-scale, lightweight robot manufactured on a single piece of composite can crawl and steer.},

Gradient-based topology optimization algorithms may efficiently solve fine-resolution problems with thousands and up to millions of design variables using a few hundred (finite element) function evaluations (and even less than 50 in some commercial codes). Nevertheless, non-gradient topology optimization approaches that require orders of magnitude more function evaluations for extremely low resolution examples keep appearing in the literature. This forum article discusses the practical and scientific relevance of publishing papers that use immense computational resources for solving simple problems for which there already exist efficient solution techniques.},

The field has since then developed rapidly with many new contributions to theory, computational methods and applications. This has that a simple editing of Bends0e (1995) had to be superseded by what meant is to a large extent a completely new book, now by two authors. This work is an attempt to provide a unified presentation of methods for the optimal design of topology, shape and material for continuum and discrete structures. The emphasis is on the now matured techniques for the topology design of continuum structures and its many applications that have seen the light of the day since the first monograph appeared. The technology is now well established and designs obtained with the use of topology optimization methods are in production on a daily basis. The efficient use of materials is important in many different settings. The aerospace industry and the automotive industry, for example, apply sizing and shape optimization to the design of structures and mechanical elements.},

Unlike conventional rigid body mechanisms, compliant mechanisms transform the displacement and force at least partly through the deformation of their structural components, which can offer a great reduction in friction, lubrication and assemblage. Therefore, compliant mechanisms are particularly suitable for applications in microscale/nanoscale manipulation systems. The significant demand of practical applications has also promoted the development of systematic design methods for compliant mechanisms. Several methods have been developed to design compliant mechanisms. In this paper, we focus on the continuum topology optimization methods and present a survey of the state-of-the-art design advances in this research area over the past 20 years. The presented overview can be helpful to those engaged in the topology optimization of compliant mechanisms who desire to be apprised of the field’s recent state and research tendency.},

The code also features a modular structure in which the analysis routine and the optimization algorithm are separated from the specific choice of topology optimization formulation. Within this framework, the finite element and sensitivity analysis routines contain no information related to the formulation and thus can be extended, developed and modified independently. We address issues pertaining to the use of unstructured meshes and arbitrary design domains in topology optimization that have received little attention in the literature. Also, as part of our examination of the topology optimization problem, we review the various steps taken in casting the optimal shape problem as a sizing optimization problem. This endeavor allows us to isolate the finite element and geometric analysis parameters and how they are related to the design variables of the discrete optimization problem. The Matlab code is explained in detail and numerical examples are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the code.},
