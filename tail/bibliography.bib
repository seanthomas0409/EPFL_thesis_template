	abstract = {Flying insects capable of navigating in highly cluttered natural environments can withstand in-flight collisions because of the combination of their low inertia1 and the resilience of their wings2, exoskeletons1 and muscles. Current insect-scale (less than ten centimetres long and weighing less than five grams) aerial robots3–6 use rigid microscale actuators, which are typically fragile under external impact. Biomimetic artificial muscles7–10 that are capable of large deformation offer a promising alternative for actuation because they can endure the stresses caused by such impacts. However, existing soft actuators11–13 have not yet demonstrated sufficient power density to achieve lift-off, and their actuation nonlinearity and limited bandwidth create further challenges for achieving closed-loop (driven by an input control signal that is adjusted based on sensory feedback) flight control. Here we develop heavier-than-air aerial robots powered by soft artificial muscles that demonstrate open-loop (driven by a predetermined signal without feedback), passively stable (upright during flight) ascending flight as well as closed-loop, hovering flight. The robots are driven by multi-layered dielectric elastomer actuators that weigh 100 milligrams each and have a resonance frequency of 500 hertz and power density of 600 watts per kilogram. To increase the mechanical power output of the actuator and to demonstrate flight control, we present ways to overcome challenges unique to soft actuators, such as nonlinear transduction and dynamic buckling. These robots can sense and withstand collisions with surrounding obstacles and can recover from in-flight collisions by exploiting material robustness and vehicle passive stability. We also fly two micro-aerial vehicles simultaneously in a cluttered environment. They collide with the wall and each other without suffering damage. These robots rely on offboard amplifiers and an external motion-capture system to provide power to the dielectric elastomer actuators and to control their flight. Our work demonstrates how soft actuators can achieve sufficient power density and bandwidth to enable controlled flight, illustrating the potential of developing next-generation agile soft robots.},

A novel closed structure compliant gripper was developed to address the challenges above. The gripper has a large self-centering work envelope and is normally-closed for passive grasping. Introduction of compliance as a form of morphological computation was also considered to enhance grasping capabilities, where multi-material 3D printing would facilitate rapid design changes based on target application. To grasp different objects, the gripper has hot-swappable 3D printed fingertips which are optimized with a multi-objective Bayesian Optimization process using physical bench experiments mimicking drone grasping and ascent on a common object set. The morphology of the fingertip including tip width, curvature and distribution of soft and hard material on contact surface, are optimized with a bench test that mimics quadcopter takeoff and landing. The best design from optimization shows an improvement of more than 10\% from the initial design in successful grasp operations, demonstrated by field tests with a quadcopter.},

In addition, the PI control gain of the controller was determined by considering the characteristics of the SMA wire, which has hysteresis response characteristics to heating and cooling.

The soft robotic gripper was made of shape memory alloys (SMAs) with contraction and variable stiffness properties. A variable stiffness mechanism with embedded sets of SMA fibers was developed; however, the response characteristics of its backbone did not comply with the constant-curvature model when it was subjected to complex forces/torques, such as gravity, grasping forces and driving torques. In this case, the Cosserat theory was used to implement real-time computations of the grasping force of the soft robotic gripper that was subjected to complex forces. Finally, a series of tests were conducted on the grasping force of the soft finger and the gripper. The elicited results showed that the grasping force is related to the stiffness and to the object's offset and friction coefficient. Moreover, experimental results showed that the grasping force of the soft robotic gripper increased by 48.7\% when the Young's modulus of the SMA-2 wires increased from 25 GPa to 48 GPa.},

Yet owing to the stochastic emergence and distribution of strain-concentrating defects and to the stiffening of nanoscale components at high strains, such composites often possess unpredictable strain–property relationships. Here, by taking inspiration from kirigami—the Japanese art of paper cutting—we show that a network of notches6,7,8 made in rigid nanocomposite and other composite sheets by top-down patterning techniques prevents unpredictable local failure and increases the ultimate strain of the sheets from 4 to 370\%. We also show that the sheets’ tensile behaviour can be accurately predicted through finite-element modelling. Moreover, in marked contrast to other stretchable conductors3,4,5, the electrical conductance of the stretchable kirigami sheets is maintained over the entire strain regime, and we demonstrate their use to tune plasma-discharge phenomena. The unique properties of kirigami nanocomposites as plasma electrodes open up a wide range of novel technological solutions for stretchable electronics and optoelectronic devices, among other application possibilities.},

Traditional microactuators used in micropumps suffer from low strokes and, as a result, are unsuitable for achieving large fluid displacement. They also suffer low-actuation work densities, which translate to low forces. We investigate the use of the shape-memory effect (SMA) in sputter-deposited thin-film shape-memory alloy (SMA) titanium nickel (TiNi) as an actuator for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based microfluidic devices, as it is capable of both high force and high strains. The resistivity of the SMA thin film is suitable for Joule heating, which allows direct electrical control of the actuator. Two micropump designs were fabricated-one with a novel complementary actuator and the other with a polyimide-biased actuator-which provided thermal isolation between the heated microactuator and the fluid being pumped. A maximum water flow rate of 50 μl/min was achieved},

Fatigue lifetime prediction methodologies for Nitinol, however, are invariably based on uniaxial loading and thus fall short of accurately predicting the safe lifetime of stents under the complex multiaxial loading conditions experienced physiologically. While there is a considerable body of research documented on the cyclic fatigue of Nitinol in uniaxial tension or bending, there remains an almost total lack of comprehensive fatigue lifetime data for other loading conditions, such as torsion and tension/torsion. In this work, thin-walled Nitinol tubes were cycled in torsion at various mean and alternating strains to investigate the fatigue life behavior of Nitinol and results compared to equivalent fatigue data collected under uniaxial tensile/bending loads. Using these strain-life results for various loading modes and an equivalent referential (Lagrangian) strain approach, a strategy for normalizing these data is presented. Based on this strategy, a fatigue lifetime prediction model for the multiaxial loading of Nitinol is presented utilizing a modified Coffin–Manson approach where the number of cycles to failure is related to the equivalent alternating transformation strain.},

A parametric study of four different, but similar, ﬁngers was conducted with the aim of obtaining a solution with a good ampliﬁcation ratio and a gripping force almost constant during closure. The use of ﬂexure hinges simpliﬁes the design, but limits the ﬁnger range of motion. Moreover, it was possible to ﬁnd a conﬁguration with sufﬁcient work space. Once the ﬁnger geometry was deﬁned, the whole hand was then designed with the aim of producing a compact hand contained in a cylindrical volume (φ 65×h 65 mm), and the ﬁrst prototype was built. Preliminary tests demonstrated its good dimensioning and the success of some technological solutions. The experimental transmission ratio was almost the same as the theoretical one. Some drawbacks have been highlighted, such as a reduced range of motion and incomplete backstroke; future studies will deal with them.},

Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are prime candidates for use in binary systems since they are simple, low cost, and lightweight. However, previously proposed bistable DEAs (flip-flop) have relatively low volumetric energy density that limits their use in practical devices. This paper investigates the potential of improving the energy density of bistable designs by employing DEAs in compact antagonistic configurations. To do so, two antagonistic configurations (linear and rotating) are designed and studied using an experimentally validated Bergstrom–Boyce viscoelastic material model. The proposed antagonistic configurations show up to ∼10× higher volumetric energy densities than flip-flop designs. This represents a significant advantage for DEA reliability, since, based on volumetric energy density, antagonist actuators require the manufacturing of significantly less film layers than flip-flop designs. This study also reveals that, in the design of antagonistic DEAs, limiting the polymer film's actuation stretch minimizes viscoelastic losses and allows higher actuation speeds and power outputs for a given actuator stroke and size.},

	abstract = {Micro aerial vehicles (MAV) with multiple rotors, or multicopters, have many promising applications ranging from environmental monitoring, agricultural inspection, to package delivery. These applications, however, usually face a critical problem: the flight time of MAVs is limited due to the low aerodynamic efficiency and high energy consumption. One promising solution is to make them rest on desired objects using perching, an important capability in biological flyers (e.g., birds). In this paper, we present the design and experimentation of a novel perching mechanism: a low cost, 3D printed gripper with bistability (i.e., two stable states). The gripper has two unique characteristics. First, using bistability, it can passively switch from open to closed state using the impact between the gripper and the perching object, alleviating the requirement for precise motion control. Second, the gripper has two perching methods for different objects. For objects with a small height, it can form a closed diamond shape to encircle the objects (encircling method). For objects with a large height, the gripper's two fingers can clip on each side of the objects to utilize the friction forces for perching (clipping method). We analyze the proposed gripper design to predict the required force for opening and closing the gripper. We also predict the size of objects that will allow for successful perching for the clipping method. All the theoretical analyses are experimentally verified. Finally, we integrate the gripper onto a palm-size quadcopter to enable a mechatronic system for perching, and demonstrate successful perching with both clipping and encircling methods as well as aerial grasping. Although our bistable gripper is used with a palm-size quadcopter, the design strategy can also be applied to large-size MAVs for both energy efficient perching and aerial grasping.},

We propose two architectures, both based on parallel leaf springs, then evaluate their isotropy defect using firstly an analytic model, secondly finite element analysis and thirdly experimental data measured from physical prototypes. Using these results, we analyze the isotropy defect in terms of displacement, radial distance, angular separation, stiffness and linearity. Based on this analysis, we propose improved architectures stacking in parallel or in series duplicate copies of the original mechanisms rotated at specific angles to cancel isotropy defect. We show that using the mechanisms in pairs reduces isotropy defect by one to two orders of magnitude.},

The state of the art recalls the abundant literature published on the parallel leaf spring stage, and presents the few articles found dealing with the parallel spring stages. The theoretical modeling for the calculation of the linear stiffness of the parallel spring stage is described. The starting point of the discussion is the observation that the theoretical model which is valid when applied to stages of large dimensions produces large errors when applied to wire-EDM machined flexures of very thin cross-sections. As an explanation of this observation, a hypothesis is put forward: on the surface of each neck a thin layer affected by the EDM process is not playing any mechanical role in the bending of the flexure and the thickness of this layer is related to the roughness of the surface. The experimental results show that the hypothesis is true to a large extent but that roughness is probably not the only factor affecting the neutral zone. The 'white layer' and the microstructural homogeneity of the material used could also be determinant.},

It is shown that the real pivot has negligible shift when subjected to load and fabrication error owing to its feature of structural symmetry, while the virtual pivot suffers from significant pivot shift, which would severely limit the wavelength tuning range. The two pivot designs are implemented into MEMS tuning structures that are fabricated by deep etching and released using a dry release approach. The real pivot measures a depth variation of 16\% over the double-clamped beam but maintains the symmetry to the midpoint, and is still able to produce a rotation angle of 4.7deg. In contrast, the virtual pivot has a depth reduction of 4\% over the cantilever beam, but achieves only a 2.4deg rotation due to the pull-in problem originated from the severe pivot shift.

However, making subgram autonomous soft robots untethered and capable of responding intelligently to the environment is a long-standing challenge. One obstacle is the low power density of soft actuators, leading to small robots unable to carry their sense and control electronics and a power supply. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), a class of electrostatic electroactive polymers, allow for kilohertz operation with high power density but require typically several kilovolts to reach full strain. The mass of kilovolt supplies has limited DEA robot speed and performance. In this work, we report low-voltage stacked DEAs (LVSDEAs) with an operating voltage below 450 volts and used them to propel an insect-sized (40 millimeters long) soft untethered and autonomous legged robot. The DEAnsect body, with three LVSDEAs to drive its three legs, weighs 190 milligrams and can carry a 950-milligram payload (five times its body weight). The unloaded DEAnsect moves at 30 millimeters/second and is very robust by virtue of its compliance. The sub–500-volt operation voltage enabled us to develop 780-milligram drive electronics, including optical sensors, a microcontroller, and a battery, for two channels to output 450 volts with frequencies up to 1 kilohertz. By integrating this flexible printed circuit board with the DEAnsect, we developed a subgram robot capable of autonomous navigation, independently following printed paths. This work paves the way for new generations of resilient soft and fast untethered robots.},

Composites consisting of silicone elastomer, polyaramid fabric, and hollow glass microspheres were used to fabricate a sufficiently large soft robot to carry the miniature air compressors, battery, valves, and controller needed for autonomous operation. Fabrication techniques were developed to mold a 0.65-meter-long soft body with modified Pneu-Net actuators capable of operating at the elevated pressures (up to 138 kPa) required to actuate the legs of the robot and hold payloads of up to 8 kg. The soft robot is safe to interact with during operation, and its silicone body is innately resilient to a variety of adverse environmental conditions including snow, puddles of water, direct (albeit limited) exposure to flames, and the crushing force of being run over by an automobile.},

	abstract = {This paper reports an untethered soft robot using soft electrostatic actuators. The robot consists of a deformable body driven by dielectric elastomer actuators, and two paper-based feet driven by electroadhesion actuators. The use of light-weight batteries and small-volume amplifiers contributes to the development of this untethered soft robot. Inspired by inchworms, this untethered soft robot can achieve locomotion through alternate expansion/contraction of its deformable body and adhesion/detachment of its two paper-based feet. The strong electroadhesion ensures a stable locomotion, and the large voltage-induced deformation and fast response of the robotic body leads to a velocity of 0.02 body length/s. This velocity is higher than that of untethered soft crawling robots based on pneumatic actuators or ionic polymer metal composites. The deformation of the robotic body is studied through finite element analysis. Compared to traditional hard robots, soft robots are found to be more susceptible to dissipative processes, including charging/discharging the actuators, dielectric relaxation and viscoelastic effects. These dissipative effects on this untethered soft robot are also investigated in this paper.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes three design concepts for developing a crawling robot inspired by an inchworm, called the Omegabot. First, for locomotion, the robot strides by bending its body into an omega shape; anisotropic friction pads enable the robot to move forward using this simple motion. Second, the robot body is made of a single part but has two four-bar mechanisms and one spherical six-bar mechanism; the mechanisms are 2-D patterned into a single piece of composite and folded to become a robot body that weighs less than 1 g and that can crawl and steer. This design does not require the assembly of various mechanisms of the body structure, thereby simplifying the fabrication process. Third, a new concept for using a shape-memory alloy (SMA) coil-spring actuator is proposed; the coil spring is designed to have a large spring index and to work over a large pitch-angle range. This large-index-and-pitch SMA spring actuator cools faster and requires less energy, without compromising the amount of force and displacement that it can produce. Therefore, the frequency and the efficiency of the actuator are improved. A prototype was used to demonstrate that the inchworm-inspired, novel, small-scale, lightweight robot manufactured on a single piece of composite can crawl and steer.},

Gradient-based topology optimization algorithms may efficiently solve fine-resolution problems with thousands and up to millions of design variables using a few hundred (finite element) function evaluations (and even less than 50 in some commercial codes). Nevertheless, non-gradient topology optimization approaches that require orders of magnitude more function evaluations for extremely low resolution examples keep appearing in the literature. This forum article discusses the practical and scientific relevance of publishing papers that use immense computational resources for solving simple problems for which there already exist efficient solution techniques.},

The field has since then developed rapidly with many new contributions to theory, computational methods and applications. This has that a simple editing of Bends0e (1995) had to be superseded by what meant is to a large extent a completely new book, now by two authors. This work is an attempt to provide a unified presentation of methods for the optimal design of topology, shape and material for continuum and discrete structures. The emphasis is on the now matured techniques for the topology design of continuum structures and its many applications that have seen the light of the day since the first monograph appeared. The technology is now well established and designs obtained with the use of topology optimization methods are in production on a daily basis. The efficient use of materials is important in many different settings. The aerospace industry and the automotive industry, for example, apply sizing and shape optimization to the design of structures and mechanical elements.},

	abstract = {Compliant mechanisms have become an important branch of modern mechanisms. Unlike conventional rigid body mechanisms, compliant mechanisms transform the displacement and force at least partly through the deformation of their structural components, which can offer a great reduction in friction, lubrication and assemblage. Therefore, compliant mechanisms are particularly suitable for applications in microscale/nanoscale manipulation systems. The significant demand of practical applications has also promoted the development of systematic design methods for compliant mechanisms. Several methods have been developed to design compliant mechanisms. In this paper, we focus on the continuum topology optimization methods and present a survey of the state-of-the-art design advances in this research area over the past 20 years. The presented overview can be helpful to those engaged in the topology optimization of compliant mechanisms who desire to be apprised of the field’s recent state and research tendency.},

The code also features a modular structure in which the analysis routine and the optimization algorithm are separated from the specific choice of topology optimization formulation. Within this framework, the finite element and sensitivity analysis routines contain no information related to the formulation and thus can be extended, developed and modified independently. We address issues pertaining to the use of unstructured meshes and arbitrary design domains in topology optimization that have received little attention in the literature. Also, as part of our examination of the topology optimization problem, we review the various steps taken in casting the optimal shape problem as a sizing optimization problem. This endeavor allows us to isolate the finite element and geometric analysis parameters and how they are related to the design variables of the discrete optimization problem. The Matlab code is explained in detail and numerical examples are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the code.},

The SERA procedure allows material to flow between two different material models: ‘real’ and ‘virtual’. The method works with two separate criteria for the rejection and admission of elements to efficiently achieve the optimum design.
